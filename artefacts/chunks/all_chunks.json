    "text": "1.1.1 University Code of Conduct\nAuthority\nThis Guide Memo was approved by the President.\nLast Updated\nJanuary 1, 2023\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 1\nThis Guide Memo defines the University's Code of Conduct.\nApplicability:\nThe Code applies to these groups of people, referred to as members of the Stanford University\nCommunity:\nFaculty, staff, students and postdoctoral scholars of Stanford University;\nMembers of the Board of Trustees;\nConsultants, contractors and others, when performing services for the University or\ninteracting with members of the University Community, acting on behalf of the University, or\notherwise required under contract to comply with this Code; and\nIndividuals who perform services for the University as volunteers.\n1. Introduction and Purpose\na. Introduction\nAll members of the University Community are responsible for sustaining the high ethical\nstandards of this institution, and of the broader community in which we function. The University\nvalues integrity, diversity, respect, freedom of inquiry and expression, trust, honesty and fairness\nand strives to integrate these values into its education, research, health care and business\npractices.\nb. Purpose\nIn that spirit, this Code is a shared statement of our commitment to upholding the ethical,\nprofessional and legal standards we use as the basis for our daily and long-term decisions and\nactions. We all must be aware of and comply with the relevant policies, standards, laws and\nregulations that guide our work. We are each individually accountable for our own actions and,\nas members of the University Community, are collectively accountable for upholding these\nstandards of behavior and for compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and policies.\n2. Standards of Integrity and Quality\nStanford recognizes that it must earn and maintain a reputation for integrity that includes, but is\nnot limited to, compliance with laws and regulations and its contractual obligations. Even the\nappearance of misconduct or impropriety can be damaging to the University. Stanford must strive\nat all times to maintain the highest standards of integrity and quality.\nThere are times when Stanford's business activities and other conduct of its University\nCommunity members are not governed by specific laws or regulations. In these instances, rules\nof fairness, honesty, and respect for the rights of others will govern our conduct at all times.\nIn addition, each individual is required to conduct University business transactions with the\nutmost honesty, accuracy and fairness. Each situation needs to be examined in accordance with\nthis standard. No unethical practice can be tolerated, even if such practice is \"customary\" outside\nof Stanford or even if some of the goals it serves are worthy. Expediency should never\ncompromise integrity.\n3. Respect for Others\nStanford University is an institution dedicated to the pursuit of excellence and facilitation of an\nenvironment that fosters this goal. Central to that institutional commitment is the principle of\ntreating each University Community member fairly and with respect, and embracing diversity and\ninclusion. See Statement from the President and Provost on Advancing Free Speech and\nInclusion (https://quadblog.stanford.edu/2017/11/07/advancing-free-speech-and-inclusion/).\nThe University prohibits discrimination and harassment and provides equal opportunities for all\nCommunity members and applicants regardless of their race, color, religious creed, national\norigin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, reproductive health decision-making, medical\ncondition, genetic information, marital status, sex, age, sexual orientation, gender, gender\nidentity, gender expression, military status, veteran status or any other characteristic protected\nby law. Where actions are found to have occurred that violate this standard the University will\ntake prompt action to cease the offending conduct, prevent its recurrence and discipline those\nresponsible.

Compliance with Laws and Applicable Policies and\nProcedures\nMembers of the Stanford University Community must transact University business in compliance\nwith applicable laws, regulations, and University policy and procedure. Managers and\nsupervisors are responsible for teaching and monitoring compliance. When questions arise\npertaining to interpretation or applicability of policy, contact the individual who has oversight of\nthe policy. Refer all unresolved questions and/or interpretation of laws and regulations to the\nOffice of the General Counsel. University-wide policy documents can be found at\npolicy.stanford.edu (http://policy.stanford.edu).\na. Contractual, Grant and Other Obligations\nThe acceptance of an agreement, including sponsored project funding, may create a legal\nobligation on the part of Stanford University to comply with the terms and conditions of the\nagreement and applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, only individuals who have authority\ndelegated by an appropriate University official may enter into agreements on behalf of the\nUniversity. See Administrative Guide Memo 5.1.1 Procurement Policies\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/5-1-1).\nb. Environmental Health & Safety, including Workplace Health and Safety\nMembers of the University Community must be committed to protecting the health and safety of\nits members by providing safe workplaces. The University will provide information and training\nabout health and safety hazards, and safeguards. University Community members must adhere\nto good health and safety practices and comply with all environmental health and safety laws and\nregulations. See Stanford Health and Safety Training Policies (https://ehs.stanford.edu/manual).\nc. Non-University Professional Standards\nSome professions and disciplines represented at the University are governed by standards and\ncodes specific to their profession (such as attorneys, certified public accountants, and medical\ndoctors). Those professional standards generally advance the quality of the profession and/or\ndiscipline by developing codes of ethics, conduct, and professional responsibility and standards\nto guide their members. Those belonging to such organizations are expected to adhere to\nUniversity policies and codes of conduct in addition to any professional standards. If a University\nCommunity member believes there is a conflict between a professional standard and University\npolicy, they should contact the Office of the General Counsel.\nd.

Conflict of Commitment/Conflict of Interest\nUniversity Community members who are Stanford faculty and staff owe their primary\nprofessional allegiance to the University and its mission to engage in the highest level of\neducation, research, health care and business practices.\nA conflict of commitment can arise when a person’s external activities, e.g., consulting\nagreements, speaking engagements, public service, personal business, etc. interfere with the\nperson’s responsibilities to the university. A conflict of commitment usually involves issues of time\nallocation.\nOutside professional activities, private financial interests or the receipt of benefits or gifts from\nthird parties can cause an actual or perceived conflict of interest.\nRelationships between Stanford and its vendors or sponsors must be free of any real or\nperceived impropriety or favoritism. University Community members should not solicit any gift,\nand should not personally accept any material gift, gratuity or payment, in cash or in kind, from\nany third party seeking to do business with the University or currently doing business with the\nUniversity.\nIn order to protect our primary mission, University Community members with other professional\nor financial interests shall disclose them in compliance with applicable conflict of\ncommitment/conflict of interest policies and, if permitted, manage them in compliance with all\ncontrols put in place.

    "text": "1.2.1 University Organization\nAuthority\nThis Guide Memo was approved by the President.\nLast Updated\nJune 22, 2015\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 11\nThis Guide Memo describes the governing organization of the University. Lists of the current\nnames of both administrative and academic officers are published in the Stanford University\nBulletin (http://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/universitygovernanceandorganization/)and in the\nStanford University Faculty/Staff Directory.\n1. Founding of the University\na. Founding Grant\nThe Leland Stanford Junior University was founded by Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford on\nNovember 11, 1885, in memory of their only child. The founding of the University was\naccomplished by a Grant of Endowment after Senator Stanford had procured passage on March\n9, 1885, of an enabling act by the legislature of the State of California. The Founding Grant\nconveyed to trustees certain properties, directed that a university be established, and outlined\nthe objectives and government of the university.\nb. Amendments\nThe Founding Grant reserved to the Founders the right to amend the Grant. In the years\nfollowing the death of Senator Stanford in 1893, Mrs. Stanford made several amendments in the\nform of addresses to the Board of Trustees on such points as the nonsectarian, nonpartisan\nnature of the University, the powers of the President, duties of the Trustees, financial\nmanagement, housing on campus, gifts from others than the Founders, summer schools,\nresearch, and tuition.\nc. Legislation and Court Decrees\nThe University operated under the Founding Grant without complications until Senator Stanford's\ndeath. However, some problems became apparent in connection with the transfer of the trust\nmoney to the Trustees, the taxation of property and revenue, and the legal status of the\nUniversity. Provisions were presented to and approved by the California legislature to correct\ndefects, and the Trustees were authorized to petition the courts for judicial decrees in matters\nconcerning the legal status of the University and the role of the Trustees.\nd. Information About the Founding\nDetailed accounts of the steps taken in the founding of Stanford University, the texts of the\nvarious legal documents, and the history of the University are in the University Archives in the\nGreen Library.

In accordance with the by-laws of the Board of Trustees, the\nPresident of the University shall be appointed or removed only by the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of the Board of Trustees.\nb.

    "text": "1.4.1 Academic and Business Relationships\nWith Third Parties\nAuthority\nThis Guide Memo was approved by the President.\nLast Updated\nAugust 11, 2014\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 14\nFrom time to time, the University enters into agreements with various independent entities that\nmay result in an ongoing business or academic relationship with the University. For example,\nentities with current relationships include Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford Bookstore,\nInc., and Stanford Federal Credit Union.\nAlthough these types of entities remain independent from the University, nonetheless, the nature\nof the relationships makes it desirable to outline how the relationships might be structured. This\nGuide Memo also provides guidance to University officers, faculty and staff concerning issues\nthat might arise and that need to be addressed prior to entering into such third party agreements.\n1. General Guidelines\na. Potential Issues\nThe agreement between the University and the other entity should make adequate provision for\nissues that may be called into play by the nature of the proposed relationship. Such issues might\ninclude the following:\nPotential property tax or unrelated business income tax imposed on the University\nFailure to appropriately file for a property tax exemption associated with leases of on-\ncampus or off-campus space\nGovernment contract and similar allocation issues\nVicarious liability to the University and indemnities\nIssues relating to public image or government scrutiny\nEffects on legal compliance of University benefit plans\nAll aspects of land use and landowner issues regarding environmental matters\nThe potential for liens or claims against Stanford property or assets\nFraud and abuse issues in the medical area\nEmployment law issues\nPrivate inurement or private use where University assets, income or facilities may be used\nin a way that benefits or results in profits to private individuals or entities\nUtilities issues\nConflicts of interest\nThe potential triggering of other statutes or governmental regulations\n \nb. Definition of Relationship\nThe agreement should provide a clear definition of the nature of the relationship and of any\nresponsibilities or obligations undertaken by the parties. The agreement should also address\nappropriate limitations on those responsibilities or obligations in both time and scope; the\ndefense and indemnification of the University in the event of suit or other adverse action; the\nneed for the University to be named as an additional insured on policies of insurance; the right of\nthe University to review financial records of the entity, where appropriate in light of the\nrelationship; and a date for termination or reevaluation of the agreement and relationship.\nc. Form of Agreement\nA detailed contract will not always be necessary; often a well-drafted business letter agreement\nmay suffice. Whatever form the agreement takes, the other parties need to understand that the\nUniversity does not seek to intrude inappropriately into the internal affairs of the other parties and\nin no way is taking on responsibility for their actions—except as to specified actions (if any) for\nspecific reasons that are relevant to the relationship and are clearly delineated in the agreement.\nLand, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE)/Real Estate department  must receive a copy of any\nlease agreement made with third parties, for consideration of property tax or property tax\nexemption issues.\n2. Approvals and Consultations\na. Delegated Authority\nThe appropriate office or offices for reviewing and/or approving an agreement will depend upon\nthe areas in which the proposed relationship arises. In this regard, please refer to the relevant\nresolutions and memoranda concerning delegations of authority by the University President, Vice\nPresidents and other senior officers. For more information concerning such delegations, contact\nthe Office of the Secretary of the Board of Trustees.\nb. Cognizant Offices\nThe following are examples of elements that may be present or contemplated and the\ncorresponding office that needs to be consulted and whose approval generally will be required in\nconnection with that element:\nElement Office\nUse of buildings or\nother facilities on\nStanford academic land\nLand, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE)/University Architect/Campus\nPlanning and Design (UA/CPD)\nUse of buildings or\nother facilities on \nStanford non-academic\nland\nLBRE/Real Estate department\nApplication for\nappropriate property\ntax exemption in\nconnection with any on-\ncampus or off-campus\nlease\nLBRE/Real Estate department\nElement Office\nUse of Stanford's\naccounting or payroll\nsystems\nController's Office\nUse of Stanford's\nbenefits programs Benefits Department\nReliance on Stanford's\ninsurance or self-\ninsurance\nOffice of Risk Management\nUse of Stanford's\nnetworks or computing\nresources\nExecutive Director of IT Services\nUse of Stanford's\npurchasing servicesPurchasing Department\nUse of Stanford\nUniversity Medical\nCenter services or\nfacilities\nThe Dean of the School of Medicine, the Chief Executive Officer of\nStanford Health Care or the Chief Executive Officer of Lucile Salter\nPackard Children’s Hospital (for activities involving their respective\norganizations)\nUse of the Stanford\nname, marks or tax\nidentification number\nThe Provost (for activities involving teaching or research), the Dean\nof the School of Medicine (for matters involving any medical activities\nat the School of Medicine), the Chief Executive Officer of Stanford\nHealth Care (for matters involving any medical activities at Stanford\nHealth Care), the Chief Executive Officer of Lucile Salter Packard\nChildren’s Hospital (for matters involving any medical activities at\nLucile Salter Packard Children’s Hospital), the Director of Business\nDevelopment (for matters involving use of Stanford tradenames or\nproducts or services offered for sale to the general public) and the\nVice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer (in all\nother situations)\nPersonnel\nAppointments (of the\nentity's personnel to\nStanford's faculty or\nstaff, or of Stanford\npersonnel to the staff or\ngoverning body of the\nentity\nThe Provost (for activities involving teaching or research), the Dean\nof the School of Medicine (for matters involving medical activities),\nand the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial\nOfficer (in all other situations)\nToxic or Hazardous\nMaterials Office of Environmental Health and Safety\nCampus Sales (by\nOutside vendors) The Director of Business Development\nElement Office\nIncome to StanfordController's Office\nLicensing of\nTechnology Office of Technology Licensing \nc. Guidance on Legal or Liability Issues\nAs a general proposition, if the arrangement presents novel legal issues, or if the Stanford\nentities involved in the relationship would like general legal guidance, the Office of the General\nCounsel should also be consulted. Similarly, the Risk Management Department should be\nconsulted on proposed relationships that raise risk or liability concerns, or whenever Stanford\npersonnel expect their activities (whether on-site or off-site) to be covered by the University's\npolicies of insurance and self-insurance.\n3.

    "text": "1.5.1 Political, Campaign and Lobbying\nActivities\nAuthority\nThis Guide Memo was approved by the President.\nLast Updated\nSeptember 24, 2020\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 15.1\nStanford University supports the expression and discussion of ideas and opinions and\nencourages members of the University community to be informed and engaged citizens. At the\nsame time, however, Stanford is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations\nregarding political activities, such as campaign activities, lobbying, and the giving of gifts to\npublic officials. This results in part because of the University’s status as a non-profit 501(c)(3)\nentity.\nWhile all members of the University community may express their political opinions and engage\nin political activities, it is very important that they do so only in their individual capacities and\navoid even the appearance that they are speaking or acting for the University in political matters.\nThe University expressly disavows any political opinions or activities that are not made in\naccordance with these provisions: such opinions and activities are not authorized and may not\nbe attributed to the University.\nIn the limited circumstances where individuals must speak or act on behalf of the University\nregarding political issues, they must do so in accordance with the provisions of this Guide Memo.\nApplicability: This policy applies to all members of the University community (including current\nfaculty, students and staff).\n1. Summary of Legal Requirements and Restrictions\na. Campaign Activities\nContributions of money, goods, or services to candidates for political office, political parties or\npolitical action committees, and in support of or opposition to ballot measure campaigns are\nsubject to a wide variety of political laws. Depending on the jurisdiction and the campaign,\npolitical contributions may be prohibited or limited and, in nearly all cases, are subject to a\ncomplicated series of disclosure rules. Because of the University's tax-exempt status, the\nUniversity is legally prohibited from endorsing or opposing candidates for political office or\nmaking any contribution of money, goods, or services to candidates, political parties or political\naction committees. It is important, therefore, that no person cause the University to make such a\ncontribution.\nb. Lobbying\nLobbying can generally be described as any attempt to influence the action of any legislative\nbody (e.g., Congress, state legislatures, county boards, city councils and their staffs) or any\nfederal, state, or local government agency. Laws regulating lobbying exist at the federal, state,\nand local levels and can differ widely in scope, depending on the jurisdiction. Some laws, for\nexample, only regulate lobbying of the legislative branch. Others, however, also cover lobbying of\nadministrative agencies and officers in the executive branch (e.g., lobbying for federally-funded\ngrants). To one degree or another, however, most lobbying laws require registration and reporting\nby individuals engaged in attempts to influence governmental action.\nTax-exempt organizations are permitted to lobby, and the University engages in lobbying on a\nlimited number of issues, mostly those affecting education, research, and related activities. There\nis usually some threshold of time or money spent on lobbying that triggers registration and\nreporting requirements. Regardless of thresholds, however, no University employee—other than\nthe following individuals, on matters under their jurisdiction—may lobby on behalf of the\nUniversity without specific authorization:\nPresident\nProvost\nDeans of the Seven Schools\nVice Provost and Dean of Research\nVice Provost for Graduate Education\nVice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer\nVice President of Human Resources\nVice President for Land, Buildings and Real Estate\nDirector of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\nDirector of the Hoover Institution\nGeneral Counsel\nVice President for External Relations\nVice President for Government Affairs\nThe Vice Provost and Dean of Research may grant permission to faculty members to lobby on\nbehalf of the University for specific purposes. The Vice President for Government Affairs may\ngrant permission to staff members to lobby on behalf of the University for specific purposes. All\nlobbying on behalf of the University should be coordinated with the Vice President for\nGovernment Affairs. Please see the Federal Lobbying Guidelines for Stanford Faculty and Staff\n(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/major-topics/federal-lobbying-\nguidelines-stanford-faculty-and-staff)in the Research Policy Handbook.\nc. Giving of Gifts to Public Officials and Staff\nAlmost all jurisdictions have strict rules on the extent to which gifts and honoraria may be given\nto public officials (both elected and non-elected officials and, often, staff). In some cases gifts\nand honoraria are prohibited; in others they are limited; and in most cases they are subject to\ndetailed disclosure. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as California, gifts to both state and\nlocal public officials can result in a public official's disqualification from participation in any\ngovernmental action affecting the interests of the donor. Meals, travel, and entertainment are the\nmost common types of gifts, but gift rules can also apply in cases where public officials attend a\nreception or receive tickets to sporting or other events.\nAs a non-profit organization, the University generally does not give gifts to public officials and, in\nthose limited cases where it does give such gifts, it must do so in accordance with all applicable\nlaws and regulations. Therefore, any University employee who, on behalf of the University,\nwishes to make a gift to a public official must receive prior approval from the Vice President for\nGovernment Affairs before making such a gift.\nd. Reporting of Political Activities\nThe University must report most of its political activities above certain thresholds. Therefore, any\nUniversity employee engaging in such activities on behalf of the University should carefully\nreview the remainder of this Guide Memo and should discuss the relevant activities in advance\nwith the Vice President for Government Affairs.\n2. Prohibited and Restricted Political, Campaign and\nLobbying Activities\na. In General:\n1. No person may, on behalf of the University, engage in any political campaign activity in\nsupport of or opposition to any candidate for elective public office (including giving or\nreceiving funds or endorsements), political party or political action committee, nor shall any\nUniversity resources be used for such purpose.\n2. No person may, on behalf of the University, lobby (or use University resources to lobby) any\nfederal, state, or local legislative or administrative official or staff member unless\nspecifically authorized to do so. Any lobbying activity, even when authorized, must be\nconducted in compliance with this Guide Memo, other applicable University policies, and\napplicable law. University resources include, but are not limited to, Interdepartmental Mail,\nequipment, personnel, supplies, computer resources, and email lists. See, e.g.,\nAdministrative Guide Memo 6.2.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-6/subchapter-\n2/policy-6-2-1)(2)(c)(4), Computer and Network Usage Policy.\n3. No person may, on behalf of the University, give a gift (or use any University resources to\ngive a gift) to any federal, state, or local official or staff member, except in compliance with\nthis Guide Memo, other applicable University policies, and applicable law.\n4. No person supporting or opposing candidates for public office, political parties or political\naction or engaging in other political campaign activities may use University space or\nfacilities or receive University support, except in the limited ways described in section 3.a.\n5. No person may use for lobbying activities federally-funded contract or grant m",

No person may use for lobbying activities federally-funded contract or grant money\nreceived by the University.\nEven the foregoing activities that are only restricted, rather than prohibited, may be subject to\nlimitations imposed by law. Therefore, any person engaging in the activity, or contemplating\ndoing so, should consult with the Vice President for Government Affairs (who will consult with the\nGeneral Counsel's Office). SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory may have additional\nrestrictions related to political activity; for guidance specific to SLAC, contact SLAC's\nCommunication Department.\nb. Guidelines for Avoiding Prohibited Political, Campaign and Lobbying\nActivities\nThe following guidelines should assist in preventing the involvement or apparent involvement of\nthe University in political activities, such as in support of or opposition to any candidate for\nelective public office (including both partisan and non-partisan elections). Except in the limited\ncircumstances set forth in section 3.b., below:\n(1) Use of Name and Seal\nNeither the name nor seal of the University or of any of its schools, departments, or institutions\nshould be used on letters or other materials intended to influence such political elections.\n(2) Use of Address and Telephones\nNo University office should be used as a return mailing address for such political mailings, and\ntelephone service that is paid by the University, likewise, should not be used for such political\npurposes. (A student's dormitory room and telephone service that are personal to the student\nmay be used for these purposes.)\n(3) Use of Title\nThe University title of a faculty or staff member or other person should be used only for\nidentification and should be accompanied by a statement that the person is speaking as an\nindividual and not as a representative of the University.\n(4) Use of Services, Resources and Equipment\nUniversity services (such as Interdepartmental Mail), equipment and other resources (such as\ncopy machines, computers and computer resources, email lists, and telephones) and supplies\nshould not be used for such political purposes.\n(5) Use of Personnel\nNo University employee may, as part of their job, be asked to perform tasks in any way related to\nprohibited political purposes.\n3. Permissible Political Activities\na. In General\nAs noted above, the federal, state, and local laws which limit the political activities that can take\nplace in University facilities and with University support in no way inhibit the expression of\npersonal political views by any individual in the University community. Nor do they forbid faculty,\nstudents, or staff from joining others in support of candidates for office or in furtherance of\npolitical causes, including political activities that are permitted in this Guide. There is no\nrestriction on discussion of political issues or teaching of political techniques. Academic\nendeavors which address public policy issues are in no way prohibited or constrained. See, e.g.,\nthe Office of Special Events and Protocol (https://osep.stanford.edu/policies/political-activities-\npolicy) Political Activities Policy and the Office of Student Engagement\n(https://ose.stanford.edu/events-0/plan-event/event-planning-guidelines/political-activities)\nPolitical Activities Policy.\nBecause the University encourages freedom of expression, there is an array of political activities\nwhich do not reasonably imply University involvement or identification that may be undertaken so\nlong as University procedures are followed for use of facilities. Examples of permissible activities\nare:\n1. Use of areas, such as White Plaza (https://ose.stanford.edu/events/plan-event/book-\nspace), by registered Stanford student organizations, University schools, institutes, and\nrecognized departments for tables, speeches, and other permissible activities--subject to\napproval by the Office of Student Engagement (https://ose.stanford.edu/events-0/plan-\nevent/event-planning-guidelines/political-activities) (for student activities) or the Office of\nSpecial Events and Protocol (https://osep.stanford.edu/policies/political-activities-policy)\n(for school, department or institute activities).\n2. Use of auditoriums or outdoor spaces for speeches by political candidates who are\nspeaking in a non-candidate capacity and subject to rules of the Internal Revenue Service,\nthe Federal Election Commission, and the California Fair Political Practices Commission,\nand other applicable laws and University policies. These events must be organized by\nregistered Stanford student organizations or University schools, institutes, and recognized\ndepartments. Arrangements must be made with the Office of Special Events and Protocol\nor the Office of Student Engagement, in consultation with the Office of Government Affairs,\nand are subject to policies that have been established by those offices for non-candidate\ncapacity appearances (including no signage or distribution of campaign materials, no\nsolicitation of votes or donations, etc.). See, e.g., Office of Special Events and Protocol\npolitical activities policy (https://osep.stanford.edu/policies/political-activities-policy) and\nOffice of Student Engagement event planning guidelines (https://ose.stanford.edu/events-\n0/plan-event/event-planning-guidelines/political-activities). These policies also apply to all\nvirtual events, webinars and symposia using varied software technologies. See also the\nUniversity Events policy and the Stanford Event Organizer\n(https://osep.stanford.edu/policies/university-events-policy-and-stanford-event-organizer)\nfor more information.\n3. Non-Stanford entities are prohibited from inviting media to the Stanford University campus\nfor any events. Stanford schools, institutes, recognized departments, and registered\nstudent organizations interested in press/media participation must work with University\nCommunications and the Office of Government Affairs and adhere to university\npress/media policies. The University will have sole responsibility for deciding whether the\npress/media will be invited to the event and will handle any such invitations.\n4. To reiterate, because tax and political compliance laws impose restrictions, or prohibitions,\non certain political activities and on the use of buildings and equipment at a non-profit\ninstitution such as the University, any such activities must be in compliance with these legal\nrequirements. Similarly, any activities must comply with local, county, state and federal and\nUniversity guidelines regarding health and safety requirements, such as with regard to\nCOVID-19.\n5. Individuals taking political positions for themselves or groups with which they are\nassociated, but not as representatives of the University, should clearly state, by words\n(such as an express disclaimer) and actions, that their positions are not those of the\nUniversity and are not being taken in an official capacity on behalf of the University.\nb. Limited University Political Activities\nLimited activities relating to specific federal, state, or local legislation or ballot initiatives are\npermissible where (1) the subject matter is directly related to core interests of the University's\nactivities; (2) the President has determined that the University should take a position; and (3) the\nindividuals who speak or write on the University's behalf are specifically authorized to do so.\n4. Research Involving Political Campaigns\nAny Stanford researcher considering doing research involving current or future elections or\npolitical campaigns should confer with the Vice Provost and Dean of Research (who will consult\nwith the General Counsel's Office for any legal restrictions), and should submit the research\nproposal in advance to Stanford's Institutional Review Board as appropriate under its policies\nand procedures.\n5.

This Guide Memo summarizes existing policies and practices\napplicable to other University employees. Additional University policies are applicable to\nemployees in individual departments and units, e.g., SLAC, Sponsored Projects and Purchasing\nServices. Individuals who use the department's services must follow the department's policies.\nPurpose: When University staff members, or members of their immediate families (defined\nbelow), have significant financial interests in, or consulting or employment arrangements with,\nother business concerns, it is important to avoid actual or apparent conflicts of interest between\ntheir University obligations and their outside interests.\nIn addition to the conflict of interest concerns mentioned above—which apply to all University\nstaff—Stanford staff members who are exempt from governmental regulations regarding\ncompensation for overtime work owe their primary professional allegiance to the University. Care\nshould be taken so that external activities do not result in inappropriate conflicts of commitment,\ni.e., conflicts regarding allocation of time and energies.\nIn order to preclude inappropriate actual or apparent conflicts of interest or conflicts of\ncommitment, this Guide Memo sets forth related University policies and procedures.\n1. Definitions\na. Significant Financial Interest\nCurrent or pending ownership interest in an entity amounting to at least one-half percent (0.5%)\nof the company's equity or at least $10,000 in ownership interest (except when the ownership is\nmanaged by a third party such as a mutual fund).\nb.

Personal Gain\nTransmitting to outsiders or otherwise using for personal gain University-funded or supported\nproperty, work products, results, materials, property records or information developed with\nUniversity funding or other support.\nb. Confidential or Privileged Information\nUsing for personal gain or other unauthorized purposes, confidential or privileged information\nacquired in connection with the individual's University-supported activities. Confidential or\nprivileged information is non-public information pertaining to the operation of any part of the\nUniversity including, but not limited to, documents so designated, medical, personnel, or security\nrecords of individuals; anticipated material requirements or price actions; knowledge of possible\nnew sites for University-supported operations; knowledge of forthcoming programs or of\nselections of contractors or subcontractors in advance of official announcements; and knowledge\nof investment decisions. Questions about confidential information may be referred to the\nUniversity Privacy Officer at privacyofficer@stanford.edu (mailto:privacyofficer@stanford.edu).\nc. Approvals\nParticipation in negotiating or giving final approval to financial or other business transactions\nbetween the University and other organizations in which the individual or an immediate family\nmember has a Significant Financial Interest or with which the individual or an Immediate Family\nMember has an employment or consulting arrangement.\nAll staff should also note that originating or approving financial or other business transactions\nbetween the University and other organizations with which the staff member has any financial or\nfamily ties (even those not rising to the level of Significant Financial Interest or constituting an\nImmediate Family Member) may create the appearance of a conflict of interest. It is required that\nall such situations be disclosed in writing to the cognizant University officer and this disclosure\nshould be documented and retained for the duration of the business relationship.\nd. Gratuities and Special Favors\nAcceptance of gratuities, unsolicited gifts exceeding $50 in value, solicited gifts in any amount or\nspecial favors from private or public organizations or individuals with which the University does or\nmay conduct business or extending gratuities or special favors to employees of any sponsoring\ngovernment or other agency or entity.\ne.

Business Relations\nAcceptance of or continuing in employment, an official relationship, or a consulting arrangement\nwith another concern which has or seeks to have a business relationship with the University.\ng. Commitment\nFor staff members exempt from governmental regulations regarding compensation for overtime\nwork: Acceptance of employment, consulting, public service, or pro bono work which can result in\nconflicts or the appearance of conflicts with a staff member's primary commitment of time and\nenergy to the University.\n3. Procedures for Exceptions\nBecause it may be in the interest of the University to grant exceptions to the rules in Section 2,\nthe following procedure has been established:\na. Disclosure\nWhenever a staff member anticipates a situation where they may be potentially in violation of the\npolicies in Section 2, that staff member must immediately make full disclosure in writing of the\ndetails of the situation, through their supervisor, to the cognizant University officer and request an\nexception. Exceptions must be approved in writing in advance. If a staff member finds that they\nhave engaged in conduct that violates the policies in Section 2, such situation must be reported\nimmediately to the cognizant University officer.\nb. Responsibility of University Officers\nAny requests for exception shall be reviewed and all facts thoroughly examined for apparent\nconflicts. Exceptions may be granted at the sole discretion of the University. If the cognizant\nUniversity officer determines that the University would best be served by the granting of the\nrequested exception, they may do so in writing with justification for the granting and delineating\nany conditions placed on the approval. Except in rare instances, University officers may not\ndelegate this responsibility and any delegation must be in writing. If the designee grants an\nexception, the designee must provide the University officer with a memorandum detailing the\ncircumstances of the exception.\nCopies of the approval must be retained throughout the period of employment.\nc. Annual Reports\nUniversity officers who receive and grant exceptions to the policies in this Guide Memo shall, at\nthe end of each academic year, provide a detailed summary report to the Provost.\nd.

It is reissued with approval of the Provost's\nOffice and Controller's Office.\nLast Updated\nDecember 15, 2010\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 15.3\n1. Policy\nStanford's resources exist to support the University's missions of creation, preservation, and\ndissemination of knowledge. The University's assets must be preserved for these purposes, not\nfor the personal gain of individuals nor for outside parties' uses which do not further Stanford's\nacademic objectives. The University receives frequent requests for access to its resources by\noutside entities, typically in exchange for some form of compensation to Stanford. Many of these,\nif granted, would constitute unrelated business activities. The purpose of this statement is to\nremind the University community that it is Stanford policy not to engage in unrelated business\nactivities.\nUnrelated business activities have the potential for distorting the University's primary teaching\nand research missions. Furthermore, revenues from such activities generally are taxable under\nthe Internal Revenue Code, and thus carry consequences to the University in terms of income\ntax liability. They also can have implications for property tax as well as product liability, and they\ncan create unfair competition with the for-profit sector.\nPermission to engage in unrelated business activities at Stanford may be granted only by the\nProvost, and then only in those cases in which there is strong likelihood that the activity will\nsignificantly benefit the University as a whole.\n2. Definition\na. Generation of Revenue\nFor the purpose of this statement, \"unrelated business activities\" are activities that use Stanford\nresources to generate revenue from third parties, and that are unrelated in a programmatic\nsense to the teaching, research, and other educational functions of the University. An unrelated\nactivity normally would not be thought to further the University's teaching or research activities,\nexcept for the revenue it produces. Because the Internal Revenue Code does not define with\nprecision what activities are unrelated for tax purposes, a general rule of thumb to apply is to\nassume that any activity undertaken primarily for the revenue it produces is likely to be unrelated.\nb. Support of Mission\nHowever, there are certain activities which might at first appear to be unrelated, but which, under\nscrutiny, are in fact related in a programmatic sense or provide direct support to Stanford's\nacademic missions. For example, certain services or programs may be conducted on campus for\nthe convenience of University faculty, staff and students, such as food sales at Tresidder.\n3. Implementation and Exceptions\na. Need for Review\nBecause of the necessarily imprecise definition of \"unrelated,\" activities that would generate\nincome and are proposed to be undertaken on behalf of an outside party that involve the use of\nUniversity lands, buildings or instrumentation or the rendering of services by University personnel\nmust be reviewed in the context of the unit's programmatic mission, Internal Revenue regulations\nand prior case rulings before they may be approved. Examples include fabrication by University\nmachine shops, testing or analysis of materials, use of University computer facilities and similar\nactivities.\nb. Responsibility\nThe responsibility for implementing this policy rests with line management. If a department chair,\ndirector, or dean has any question as to whether a proposed arrangement under their purview\nmight constitute an unrelated business activity, it is their responsibility to have the activity\nreviewed by the cognizant vice president's office, who in turn may need to seek counsel from the\nController's Office—University Tax Director. Questions arising from departments or schools\nreporting to the Provost should be directed to the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of\nResearch.\nc. Exceptions\nIf the cognizant vice president endorses a request for an arrangement that is determined to be\nan unrelated business activity, the proposal should be forwarded to the Controller's Office for a\nreview of the potential tax consequences, and means of accommodating them, before the\nrequest is sent to the Provost for approval.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/conflict-\ninterest/unrelated-business-activity",

    "text": "1.6.2 Privacy and Security of Health\nInformation (HIPAA)\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer and the Vice\nPresident of Human Resources.\nLast Updated\nMarch 15, 2013\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 16.2\nThis Guide Memo describes Stanford University's implementation of the Health Insurance\nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") and its regulations (\"Privacy Rule\" and\n\"Security Rule\") governing the protection of identifiable health information by health care\nproviders and health plans. The portions of Stanford University that are impacted by HIPAA\ninclude the Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Group Health Plan, defined in\nSections 3 and 4, respectively.\nThis Guide Memo references Stanford University HIPAA Components policies on the University\nHIPAA website (https://privacy.stanford.edu/policies/hipaa-privacy-policies) and the Group Health\nPlan HIPAA policies. The Group Health Plan maintains HIPAA policies and procedures in the\nResource Library section of the Benefits website (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-\nrewards). These policies outline more specific rights of individuals regarding their protected\nhealth information (\"PHI\") as well as the operational and system requirements to comply with the\nPrivacy and Security Rules.\nApplicability: This policy applies to all staff, faculty, physicians, volunteers, students,\nconsultants, contractors and subcontractors who are part of the Stanford University HIPAA\nComponents and the Stanford University Group Health Plan (\"Group Health Plan\") workforce.\nStanford Health Care (\"SHC\"), including Menlo Health Alliance and Lucile Packard Children's\nHospital (\"LPCH\"), and their respective ERISA health benefit plans have separate HIPAA\npolicies.\n1. The Privacy Rule\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") Privacy Rule limits\nStanford University's use and disclosure of information that could potentially associate an\nindividual's identity with their health information. Stanford University may not use or disclose PHI\nexcept as authorized by the individual, or as permitted or required by law. Use or disclosure of\nhealth information that does not have the potential to reveal an individual's identity is not limited.\n2. The Security Rule\nThe Security Rule requires Stanford University to implement administrative, technical, and\nphysical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI maintained in an\nelectronic form (\"ePHI\") and to protect ePHI against any reasonably anticipated threats or\nhazards, unauthorized uses or disclosures. The Security Rule protects ePHI stored in University\nsystems during processing and during transmission\n3. Stanford University HIPAA Components Designation\nThe portions of Stanford University that provide health care, or share PHI with those portions, are\n\"health care components\" and are known collectively as the \"Stanford University HIPAA\nComponents.\" Stanford University has authorized its Privacy Officer to designate the health care\ncomponents to be included in the Stanford University HIPAA Components. A list of the schools,\ndepartments and functions designated as part of the Stanford University HIPAA Components can\nbe found on the Stanford University HIPAA website (https://privacy.stanford.edu/policies/hipaa-\nprivacy-policies) or requested from the University Privacy Officer. Anyone who believes that their\ndepartment or program uses or discloses PHI and ought to be designated as part of the Stanford\nUniversity HIPAA Components should contact the University Privacy Officer.\nIn addition, the Stanford University HIPAA Components have joined Stanford Health Care\n(\"SHC\"), including Menlo Health Alliance and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford\n(\"LPCH\") which are together referred to as the \"Hospitals,\" to form a single affiliated entity under\nthe Privacy and Security Rules, known as the Stanford Affiliated Covered Entity. By combining as\na single affiliated entity, the Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Hospitals have the\ngreatest flexibility to share information with one another to accomplish their missions.\n4. Group Health Plan\nAs an employer, Stanford University sponsors and maintains various ERISA health benefits plans\nthat comprise the Group Health Plan. The Group Health Plan is a separate covered entity from\nthe Stanford University HIPAA Components and, as such, has separate HIPAA privacy and\nsecurity policies. The list of the plans included in the Group Health Plan can be found on the\nStanford University HIPAA website (https://privacy.stanford.edu/policies/hipaa-privacy-policies) or\nrequested from the University Privacy Officer.\n5. Privacy and Security Information\na. Privacy Officials\nStanford University has designated a HIPAA privacy officer (the \"University Privacy Officer\") for\nthe Stanford University HIPAA Components, the Stanford Affiliated Covered Entity and the Group\nHealth Plan. The University Privacy Officer is responsible for the development and\nimplementation of the policies and procedures necessary to comply with the Privacy Rule.\nContact information for the University Privacy Officer is located in Section 13.\nThe University Privacy Officer may request that local privacy officials be designated by a school,\ndepartment or program included in the Stanford University HIPAA Components or by the Group\nHealth Plan (collectively and individually referred to as \"Program\") as necessary in order to\nimplement the policies within their program effectively. Programs will promptly comply with any\nsuch request.\nb. Security Officials\nStanford University has designated a HIPAA security officer (the \"Chief Information Security\nOfficer\") for the Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Group Health Plan. The Chief\nInformation Security Officer is responsible for the security of Stanford University HIPAA\nComponents and Group Health Plan ePHI, including development of the policies and procedures\nnecessary to comply with the Security Rule and the implementation of security measures to\nprotect ePHI. Contact information for the Chief Information Security Officer is located in Section\n13.\nThe Chief Information Security Officer may designate local security officials (\"delegates\") as\nnecessary to facilitate the implementation of policies, local procedures, and security measures.\n6. Policies and Procedures\nThe University Privacy Officer has developed policies and guidelines designed to keep the\nStanford University HIPAA Components and the Group Health Plan in compliance with the\nPrivacy Rule. The University Privacy Officer may add or modify policies and guidelines as\nnecessary and appropriate to incorporate changes in the law or to improve the effectiveness of\ncompliance with the Privacy Rule.\nThe Chief Information Security Officer has developed policies and guidelines to comply with the\nSecurity Rule and may add or modify those policies and guidelines as necessary and appropriate\nto improve Security Rule compliance.\nEach of the Stanford University HIPAA Components programs and the Group Health Plan must\ndevelop, implement, document, and train its workforce on the procedures necessary to comply\nwith the appropriate HIPAA policies and this Administrative Guide Memo. For information\nconcerning specific program procedures, workforce members should contact the local privacy or\nsecurity official, as appropriate, or their supervisor.\nPrograms will comply with requests by the University Privacy Officer, the Chief Information\nSecurity Officer, the Office of the General Counsel and/or the Internal Audit Department to make\nwritten procedures and training materials available for review.\n7. Safeguards\nThe Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Group Health Plan will institute reasonable\nand appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect PHI from any\nintentional, incidental or unintentional use or disclosure that is in v",

Training\nThe Stanford University HIPAA Components and Group Health Plan will train members of their\nrespective workforces, including management, on the Stanford University privacy and security\npolicies and Program procedures to the extent necessary or appropriate for the members of the\nworkforce to carry out their functions. New members of the workforce for whom HIPAA training is\nnecessary or appropriate will be trained prior to initial contact with PHI and in no event later than\n30 days from the first date of employment. Each member of the workforce whose functions are\naffected by a material change in the policies or procedures will be trained on those changes in a\ntimely manner, but normally not later than 30 working days from the effective date of the change.\nPrograms will document that workforce training has been completed and will retain these records\nin the format requested by the University Privacy Officer and Chief Information Security Officer.\nTraining documentation will be provided on request to the University Privacy Officer or the\nSecretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.\nThe Chief Information Security Officer will implement a security awareness program to instruct all\nworkforce members on good security practices. The content of the security awareness program\nwill include, but not be limited to information about (a) guarding against, detecting and reporting\nmalicious software, (b) monitoring login attempts and reporting discrepancies, and (c) creating,\nchanging and safeguarding passwords. The program will include periodic updates and reminders\non pertinent security measures and issues, including environmental and operational changes\naffecting the security of ePHI.\n9. Violations\nAnyone who knows or has reason to believe that the Privacy Rule and/or Security Rule, the\nStanford University HIPAA policies, the policies contained in this Administrative Guide Memo, or\nany Program procedure developed to implement these regulations and policies have been\nviolated should report the matter promptly to their supervisor, a local HIPAA official, the University\nPrivacy Officer or Chief Information Security Officer, as appropriate. All reported matters will be\ninvestigated in a timely manner and, when possible, will be handled confidentially.\nSee Appendix A: Guidelines for the Implementation of Corrective Action in Matters Involving\nViolations of Patient, Research Participant and other Medical Information Privacy or Security.\nIf the workforce member requires anonymity, their may also report such matters to the\nInstitutional Compliance Hotline (https://ocro.stanford.edu/ethics-compliance/ethics-and-\ncompliance-helpline). If the workforce member does not have internet access, their may contact\nInstitutional Compliance at (650) 721-COMP or 721-2667.\nTo the extent practical, any known harmful effect from a violation of the Privacy Rule or the\nSecurity Rule or a security incident will be mitigated. Where appropriate, sanctions will be\nconsidered and imposed by the program and/or the University. Programs should document all\ninvestigations, resolutions, remedies and sanctions, and forward a copy of such documentation\nto the University Privacy Officer or Chief Information Security Officer, as appropriate.\n10. Refraining from Intimidating or Retaliatory Attacks\nThe Stanford University HIPAA Components and Group Health Plan will not intimidate, threaten,\ncoerce, discriminate against, or take other retaliatory action against any patient, physician,\nemployee, or any other person for exercising their rights, or for participating in any process,\nestablished under the Privacy Rule or Security Rule, including submitting a complaint or\nreporting a violation. Any attempt to retaliate against a person for reporting a violation in\naccordance with Section 9 above, may itself be considered a violation of this policy and may\nresult in sanctions. An individual who raises concerns about any act or practice allegedly made\nunlawful by the Privacy Rule or the Security Rule, however, must have a good faith belief that the\nact or practice is unlawful, and the manner of raising such concerns must be reasonable and not\nviolate the Privacy Rule or Security Rule.\n11. Sanctions\nViolations of the Privacy Rule or Security Rule may, under certain circumstances, result in civil or\ncriminal penalties. Members of the workforce who violate the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule,\npolicies contained in this Guide Memo or the Stanford University HIPAA policies, or any\nprogram's procedures implementing these policies, may be subject to disciplinary action up to\nand including termination of employment, contract, or other relationship with the University.\nSee Appendix A: Guidelines for the Implementation of Corrective Action in Matters Involving\nViolations of Patient, Research Participant and other Medical Information Privacy or Security.\n12. Evaluation and Reporting\nEach program will provide to the University Privacy Officer or Chief Information Security Officer\nall requested information in order that the University Privacy Officer or Chief Information Security\nOfficer may (a) adequately address complaints, (b) respond to requests from the Secretary of the\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or other HHS official, and (c)\ninform Stanford University or Hospital leadership about compliance with the Privacy and Security\nRules.\nStanford University HIPAA Components and the Group Health Plan will periodically, and when\ndeemed necessary in response to environmental or operational changes affecting the security of\nePHI (e.g., newly identified security risks, newly adopted technologies), conduct a technical and\nnon-technical evaluation of its security safeguards to establish the extent to which its security\npolicies and procedures meet the requirements of the Security Rule, and document its\ncompliance with the Security Rule.\n13. For More Information\nQuestions: If you have questions about these policies, please contact your supervisor.\nDepartment management should contact the appropriate program official and/or the University\nPrivacy Officer (with respect to the Privacy Rule) or the Chief Information Security Officer (with\nrespect to the Security Rule) with any questions related to the interpretation of these policies\nand/or the development of departmental procedures. It is important that all questions be resolved\nas soon as possible to ensure compliance with the Privacy Rule and Security Rule.\nUniversity Privacy Office, privacy@stanford.edu (mailto:privacy@stanford.edu) or call\n(650) 725-1828\nInformation Security Office, securityofficer@stanford.edu\n(mailto:securityofficer@stanford.edu)\n14.

These guidelines should be used in conjunction with the corrective action or\ndiscipline policy applicable to the relevant workforce member including:\nGuide Memo 1.1.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-\nprinciples/university-code-conduct/university-code-conduct):Code of Conduct\nGuide Memo 2.1.16 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-\nemployment-policies/addressing-conduct-and-performance-issues): Addressing Conduct\nand Performance Issues\nCollective Bargaining Agreement between SEIU Local 2007 and Stanford\n(https://drive.google.com/file/d/13P2xv0kEhFbizMSJ8YiHfJvS2UjtsDcW/view) Section 12.7\nFaculty Handbook Chapter 4.3 (https://facultyhandbook.stanford.edu/4-core-policy-\nstatements#4.3) (Statement on Faculty Discipline)\nThe Fundamental Standard for Students\n(https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/honor-code)\nMD Program Handbook Chapter 8 (Committee on Performance, Professionalism &\nPromotion)\nResearch Policy Handbook Chapter 10 (https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-\npolicy-handbook/non-faculty-research-appointments) (Non Faculty Research\nAppointments)\nFor definitions pertaining to HIPAA and frequently asked questions relating to HIPAA and other\napplicable laws relating to the protection of patient health information, see the University's HIPAA\n(https://privacy.stanford.edu/policies/hipaa-privacy-policies) website.\nPRINCIPLES\nA. Imposition of Appropriate Sanctions\nWorkforce members will be sanctioned appropriately in the event that they:\n1. access, use or disclose more than the minimum PHI necessary to complete their job-\nrelated functions;\n2. fail to adequately protect PHI in accordance with Stanford University's information security\npolicies;\n3. fail to promptly report a known or suspected HIPAA violation; or\n4. violate any of Stanford University's other HIPAA policies, procedures or guidelines.\nSanctions may also be imposed for failure to report a known or suspected HIPAA violation or for\nviolating any of Stanford University's other HIPAA policies, procedures or guidelines. Sanctions\nfor violations of HIPAA may include, without limitation, counseling, written warning, suspension,\nand termination. A workforce member's compensation and eligibility to continue in an academic\nor training program may also be impacted in the event of a violation. These guidelines are not\nintended to dictate a particular consequence in any particular situation. Rather, in consultation\nwith the appropriate Human Resources and/or Privacy Office, managers, academic affairs and\nstudent affairs administrators have the discretion to decide:\n1. at which level to start the corrective action process based on the severity of the offense, the\npotential or actual harm to the patient and/or the Hospital(s) or University, and any\nmitigating factors; and\n2. whether immediate termination is justified based on the seriousness of the offense.\nB. Levels of Violations\nThe level of a violation is determined by the severity of the privacy or security breach, whether\nthe breach was intentional or unintentional or motivated by malice or personal gain, and the\nimpact on the patient and/or institution. The following outlines some, but not all, types of\nviolations and categorizes them broadly according to likely severity.\nLevel 1:\nA workforce member carelessly or inadvertently accesses PHI without a job-related need to\nknow, or carelessly or unintentionally reveals PHI to which their has authorized access.\nExamples of Level 1 violations include, but are not limited to:\n1. Leaving PHI in a public area in the workplace or disposing of it in the trash instead of\nshredding receptacles;\n2. Misdirecting faxes, emails or other documents that contain PHI;\n3. Discussing PHI in public areas where the discussion could be overheard;\n4. Other behaviors reflecting carelessness or lack of judgment in handling PHI.\nLevel 2:\nA workforce member intentionally accesses PHI without authorization or seriously fails to protect\nPHI. Examples of Level 2 violations include, but are not limited to:\n1. Intentionally accessing or asking another to access PHI without a job-related need to know,\nthe PHI or a friend, relative, co-worker, public personality or any other individual (including\nsearching for the existence of a record or an address or phone number);\n2. Leaving paper files and records, computers, laptops, notebooks, smart phones or other\ndevices containing PHI accessible and unattended;\n3. Sharing log-in IDs and passwords with others;\n4. Using personal email accounts (e.g., Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo), cloud computing, or other\nmedia or storage devices not approved by Stanford University for transmission or storage\nof PHI or not meeting required security standards (such as encryption, secure email,\npassword protection);\n5. Removing PHI from the Stanford University workplace without supervisor approval or failing\nto appropriately safeguard PHI if removed with supervisor approval or while in transit;\n6. Other behaviors reflecting intentional conduct or serious failure to safeguard PHI.\nLevel 3:\nA workforce member intentionally accesses, uses or discloses PHI without authorization, often\nmotivated by willful disregard, malice or personal gain. A Level 3 violation is considered serious\nmisconduct. Examples of Level 3 violations include, but are not limited to:\n1. Intentionally using or disclosing without a job-related need to know the PHI of a friend,\nrelative, co-worker, public personality, or any other individual’s PHI;\n2. Accessing, using or disclosing PHI for personal purposes or gain, or with an intent to harm\nthe patient or any third party;\n3. Discussing or disclosing PHI with any third party either directly or via social networking or\nblogging sites, such as Twitter and Facebook.\n4. Intentionally assisting an individual in gaining unauthorized access to PHI.\n5. Jeopardizing the integrity of Stanford University’s systems.\n6. Failing to cooperate during the investigation of a privacy or security incident.\n7. Falsifying information during a privacy investigation or reporting in bad faith or for malicious\npurposes.\n8. Other behaviors reflecting personal purpose or gain, malice or misconduct.\nC. Considerations in Evaluating Violation for Appropriate Sanctions\nFactors in determining appropriate disciplinary action may include, but are not limited to:\n1. Whether the breach was intentional or inadvertent;\n2. The nature of the breach, including whether the breach involved specially\nprotected information such as HIV, psychiatric, substance abuse, or genetic data;\n3. The magnitude of the breach, including the number of patients and the volume of\nprotected health information accessed, used or disclosed;\n4. The workforce member’s motive in accessing, using or disclosing PHI, and whether there\nwas an element of malice or desire for personal gain;\n5.

Policy Statement\nStanford University strives to provide a place of work and study free of discrimination on the\nbasis of sex, which includes sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic and dating violence,\nstalking, and other forms of sexual misconduct. Where such sexual misconduct has occurred,\nthe University will act to stop the misconduct, prevent its recurrence, and discipline and/or take\nother appropriate action against those responsible. This Guide Memo outlines the University’s\ndefinitions and policies relating to sexual misconduct and in compliance with Title IX of the\nEducation Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681) and its implementing regulations (34 C.F.R.\n106), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e), the Clery Act (20 U.S.C. 1092(f))\nand its implementing regulations (34 C.F.R. 668.46), California Education Code sections 67380,\n67383 and 67386, and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act of 1959 (“FEHA”)\nCalifornia Government Code sections 12900 - 12996.[1] (#_ftn1) This policy also applies to\nviolations of University directives or court orders and acts of intimidation or retaliation relating to\nthe aforementioned conduct or allegations of such conduct.\n2. Policy Violations\nProhibited Sexual Conduct is the umbrella term that Stanford uses under this Policy to\ncollectively define different types of misconduct relating to sexual harassment, sexual assault,\ndomestic and dating violence, stalking, or exploitation of a sexual nature. Stanford prohibits all\nforms of Prohibited Sexual Conduct. Stanford is obligated to comply with both state and federal\nlaws with respect to reports of Prohibited Sexual Conduct, when applicable. It is also a violation\nof this Policy to engage in Retaliation or Intimidation (as those terms are defined below) or to\nviolate a University Directive or Court Order (as those terms are defined below) related to\nProhibited Sexual Conduct or allegations of Prohibited Sexual Conduct.\nRegardless of the source of the definition (state, federal, or University), it is a violation of this\nPolicy to commit or attempt to commit any of the acts defined below or to knowingly aid or\nfacilitate another person to commit any act of the acts defined below.\na. Sexual Harassment\nStanford is committed to the principles of free inquiry and free expression. Vigorous discussion\nand debate are fundamental to the University, and this policy is not intended to stifle teaching\nmethods or freedom of expression generally, nor will it be permitted to do so. However, Sexual\nHarassment is neither legally protected expression nor the proper exercise of academic freedom.\nIt compromises the integrity of the University, its tradition of intellectual freedom, and the trust\nplaced in its members.\nTitle IX Sexual Harassment (applies to all community members)\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681) and its implementing regulations\n(34 C.F.R. 106) prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, including in the form of sexual\nharassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Each of those\nterms has a special definition within the law. For purposes of this policy, the term “Title IX Sexual\nHarassment” has the meaning defined directly below. The other forms of sex-based\ndiscrimination prohibited by Title IX and its regulations (including forms of sexual assault, dating\nviolence, domestic violence, and stalking) are defined separately in this policy.\nTitle IX Sexual Harassment involves conduct, on the basis of sex, that satisfies one or more of\nthe following:\nUnwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, AND\nobjectively offensive that it denies a person equal educational access; OR\nAn employee of the University conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the\nrecipient on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct.\nEmployment-Related Sexual Harassment (applies in employment-related matters)\nEmployment-Related Sexual Harassment is conduct that is outside the scope or jurisdiction of\nTitle IX and, therefore is addressed under the applicable procedure to this form of harassment,\nas described in Section 8, below. In addition, Employment-Related Sexual Harassment may be\nconduct that is part of overall conduct that rises to the level of a Title IX Sexual Harassment\nmatter. In such scenarios, the employee would be charged with Title IX Sexual Harassment and\nthe University will concurrently review the matter for a violation of Employment-Related Sexual\nHarassment. Where conduct constitutes both Title IX Sexual Harassment and Employment-\nRelated Sexual Harassment, the Employment-Related Sexual Harassment will not serve as a\nbasis for additional discipline.\nEmployment-Related Sexual Harassment is conduct, on the basis of sex, that involves one or\nmore of the following:\nUnwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other visual, verbal, or\nphysical conduct of a sexual nature constitute Employment-Related Sexual Harassment\nwhen:\nIt is implicitly or explicitly suggested that submission to or rejection of the conduct will\nbe a factor in employment decisions or evaluations, or permission to participate in a\nUniversity activity; OR\nThe conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s\nwork performance or creating an intimidating or hostile work environment.\nDetermining what constitutes Employment-Related Sexual Harassment depends on the specific\nfacts and context in which the conduct occurs. Employment-Related Sexual Harassment may\ntake many forms; subtle and indirect or blatant and overt. For example, it may:\nBe conduct toward an individ",

For example, it may:\nBe conduct toward an individual of the same or different gender, gender expression,\ngender identity or sexual orientation;\nOccur between peers or between individuals in a hierarchical relationship;\nBe aimed at coercing an individual to participate in an unwanted sexual relationship or it\nmay have the effect of causing an individual to change behavior or work performance; or\nConsist of repeated actions or may even arise from a single incident if sufficiently\negregious.\nWhether the unwanted sexual conduct rises to the level of creating an intimidating or hostile\nenvironment is determined using both a subjective standard (that is, a person has been offended\nby the conduct) and an objective standard (that is, a reasonable person under similar\ncircumstances to the Complainant would find the conduct to be sufficiently severe, persistent OR\npervasive so as to interfere with the ability to participate in or benefit from the University’s\nservices, activities, or opportunities).\nUniversity Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students\nFor all student-related matters in a non-employment matter, University Prohibited Sexual\nHarassment between Students is conduct that is outside the scope or jurisdiction of Title IX, and\ntherefore is addressed under the applicable procedure to this form of harassment. In addition,\nUniversity Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students may be conduct that is part of\noverall conduct that rises to the level of a Title IX Sexual Harassment matter. In such scenarios,\nthe student would be charged with Title IX Sexual Harassment, and the University will\nconcurrently review the matter for a violation of University Prohibited Sexual Harassment\nbetween Students. Where conduct violates both Title IX Sexual Harassment and University\nProhibited Sexual Harassment between Students, the violation of University Prohibited Sexual\nHarassment between Students will not serve as a basis for additional discipline.\nUniversity Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students is conduct that involves one or more\nof the following:\nA student in a position of authority in a student organization conditioning the provision of\nmembership, aid, benefit, or service on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual\nconduct; OR\nUnwelcome sexual advances, and other visual, verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual\nnature when the conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an\nindividual's academic performance or creating an intimidating or hostile academic or\nstudent living environment.\nDetermining what constitutes University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students\ndepends on the specific facts and context in which the conduct occurs. University Prohibited\nSexual Harassment between Students may take many forms: subtle and indirect or blatant and\novert. For example, it may:\nBe conduct toward an individual of the same or different gender, gender expression,\ngender identity, or sexual orientation;\nOccur between peers or between individuals in a hierarchical relationship;\nBe aimed at coercing an individual to participate in an unwanted sexual relationship or\nhave the effect of causing an individual to change behavior; or\nConsist of repeated actions or may even arise from a single incident if sufficiently\negregious.\nWhether the unwanted sexual conduct rises to the level of creating an intimidating or hostile\nenvironment is determined using both a subjective standard (that is, a person has been offended\nby the conduct) and an objective standard (that is, a reasonable person under similar\ncircumstances to the Complainant would find the conduct to be sufficiently severe, persistent OR\npervasive so as to interfere with the ability to participate in or benefit from the University’s\nservices, activities, or opportunities).\nb. Sexual Assault (applies to all community members)\nConsent\nThe following definitions apply to all acts of Sexual Assault described below:\nAffirmative Consent means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in\nsexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to\nensure that the person has the Affirmative Consent of the other or others to engage in the\nsexual activity. Lack of protest or resistance does not mean Affirmative Consent, nor does\nsilence mean Affirmative Consent. Affirmative Consent must be ongoing throughout a\nsexual activity and can be revoked at any time. Affirmative Consent may be based on a\ncondition(s), e.g., the use of a condom, and that condition(s) must continue to be met\nthroughout an activity, unless there is mutual agreement to forego or change the condition.\nWhen there is no Affirmative Consent present during sexual activity, the activity at issue\nnecessarily occurred “against the person’s will.”\nThe existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of\npast sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an\nindicator of Affirmative Consent.\nIn evaluating Affirmative Consent, it cannot be a defense that a respondent’s belief\nthat the complainant consented to the sexual activity arose under either of the\nfollowing circumstances:\nThe respondent’s belief in Affirmative Consent arose from the intoxication or\nrecklessness of the respondent.\nThe respondent did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to\nthe respondent at the time, to ascertain whether the complainant gave\nAffirmative Consent.\nIncapacitation: It shall not be a valid excuse that the respondent believed that the\ncomplainant Affirmatively Consented to sexual activity if the respondent knew or\nreasonably should have known that the complainant was Incapacitated. Incapacitation\nmeans the complainant was unable to Affirmatively Consent because the complainant was\nasleep, unconscious, under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication, such that the\ncomplainant could not understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual activity, or was\nunable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition. Incapacitation is not\nnecessarily the same as legal intoxication.\nStranger and Nonstranger Sexual Assault\nThe following definitions apply to all acts of Sexual Assault described below:\nFor the purposes of this Policy, a nonstranger is someone known to the Complainant, whether\nthrough a casual meeting or through a longstanding relationship, including a dating or domestic\nrelationship. A stranger is someone unknown to the Complainant at the time of the Sexual\nAssault.\nCalifornia law requires universities to describe how a school will respond to instances of stranger\nand non-stranger Sexual Assault: Stanford applies the same policies and sanctions for both\nstranger and nonstranger Sexual Assault.\nTitle IX & University Sexual Assault\nTitle IX & University Sexual Assault any sexual act[3] (#_ftn3) directed against a Complainant\nwithout the Affirmative Consent of the Complainant, including instances in which the Complainant\nis incapable of giving consent, including because of Incapacitation.\nTitle IX Nonforcible Sexual Violations\nTitle IX Nonforcible Sexual Violations include the following \nIncest. Nonforcible sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other\nwithin the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by California law.[4] (#_ftn4)\nStatutory Intercourse Violation. Nonforcible sexual intercourse with a person who is\nunder the statutory age of consent of California. The age of consent in California is 18.[5]\n(#_ftn5)\nUniversity Nonforcible Sexual Violations[6]\nUniversity Nonforcible Sexual Violations include conduct involving one or more of the following:\nInducing Incapacitation.

Relationship Violence (applies to all community members)\nRelationship Violence includes conduct involving one or more of the following:\nDating Violence.[7] (#_ftn7) Violence committed by a person who is or has been in a\nsocial relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the Complainant. The existence of\nsuch a relationship is determined based on the Complainant’s statement and with\nconsideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of\ninteraction between the persons involved in the relationship.\nFor the purposes of this definition:\nDating Violence includes, but is not limited to, sexual or physical abuse or the threat of\nsuch abuse.\nDating Violence does not include acts covered under the definition of Domestic Violence\nDomestic Violence.[8] (#_ftn8) An act that could be classified as a felony or misdemeanor\ncrime of violence committed:\nBy a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the Complainant;\nBy a person with whom the Complainant shares a child in common;\nBy a person who is cohabitating with, or has cohabitated with, the Complainant as a\nspouse or intimate partner;\nBy a person similarly situated to a spouse of the Complainant under the domestic or\nfamily violence laws of California;\nBy any other person against an adult or youth Complainant who is protected from that\nperson’s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of California.\nTo categorize an incident as Domestic Violence, the relationship between the Respondent and\nthe Complainant must be more than just two people living together as roommates. The people\ncohabitating must be current or former spouses or have an intimate relationship.\nUniversity Relationship Violence. University Relationship Violence includes verbal or\nnon-verbal communication with the intent to harm another person emotionally, intimidate\nanother person, and/or exert control over another person, of an ongoing and severe nature\nsuch that it would cause a reasonable person to experience severe distress, to be fearful\nfor their safety and/or to significantly alter daily routines and activities in order to ensure\ntheir safety. University Relationship Violence may occur in a current or former romantic or\nintimate relationship regardless of the length of the relationship or gender/gender identity of\nthe individuals in the relationship.\nd. Stalking (applies to all community members)[9]\nStalking includes conduct involving the following:\nEngaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a\nreasonable person to:\nFear for the person’s safety or the safety of others; or\nSuffer substantial emotional distress.\nFor the purposes of this definition:\nCourse of conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which\nthe stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device,\nor means, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or\nabout a person, or interferes with a person’s property.\nReasonable person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and\nwith similar identities to the Complainant.\nSubstantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may\nbut does not necessarily require medical or other professional treatment or\ncounseling.\ne. Violation of a University Directive or Court Order (applies to all community\nmembers)\nViolation of a University Directive or Court Order includes the following:\nViolation of a University Directive. The failure to comply with a directive issued by the\nUniversity that restricts the activities of an individual in connection with an allegation or\nfinding of violation under this Policy.\nViolation of a Court Order. The failure to comply with any formal order issued by a state\nor federal court or authorized police officer that restricts a person’s access to another\nStanford community member, such as an emergency, temporary or permanent restraining\norder.\nf. Retaliation and Intimidation (applies to all community members)\nIt is a violation of this Policy to Intimidate or Retaliate against any person making a complaint or\nresponding to a complaint or against any person participating in the investigation of any such\nallegation under this Policy (including being the Respondent or participating as a Witness). No\nperson may threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for pursuing or exercising\nany right or privilege secured by this Policy, or because the individual has made a report or\ncomplaint, responded to a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate\nin any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing related to this Policy.\nRetaliation includes, but is not limited to, adverse action related to employment, academic\nopportunities, participation in University programs or activities, or similar punitive action.\nRetaliation can be direct such as changing an employee’s work location, pay or schedule,\nor for students, changing a grade or denying access to a program, or it can be indirect such\nas Intimidating, threatening, or harassing an employee or student who has raised a claim or\nparticipated as a witness in an investigation.\nIntimidation can be a form of Retaliation, and includes any threatening statement or\nconduct made with the intent to prevent or dissuade any party or witness from reporting or\nparticipating in the process.\nAll parties to a concern and all persons participating in the investigation of a concern are\nprohibited from engaging in actions intended to Retaliate or Intimidate directly or through support\npersons.\nCharging an individual with a code of conduct violation for making a materially false statement in\nbad faith in the course of an investigation does not constitute Retaliation, provided, however, that\na determination regarding responsibility, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that any party made a\nmaterially false statement in bad faith. The exercise of rights protected under the First\nAmendment does not constitute Retaliation.\n3. Immediate Steps/Emergency Resources/Supportive\nMeasures\nIf you or someone you know has experienced Prohibited Sexual Conduct, here are some\nimmediate steps to consider:\nIf the individual is in immediate danger, or believes there could be an ongoing threat to the\nindividual or the community, please call 911 or 9-911 from a campus phone or use a blue\nemergency phone tower on campus.\nThe individual that experienced the conduct is encouraged to contact the police, although\nthe individual is not required to make a report to the police. For Prohibited Sexual Conduct\nthat occurs on the Stanford campus, individuals can contact the Stanford Department of\nPublic Safety at (650) 723-9633. For an off-campus incident, individuals can call the local\npolice jurisdiction: Palo Alto, (650) 329-2307; Menlo Park, (650) 325-4424. University\nofficials also will assist individuals in contacting local law enforcement authorities, if the\nindividual requests assistance. If the individual believes that there is an ongoing threat to\nsafety from a particular individual, the individual may request an emergency protective\nrestraining order from a California police officer.\nCalifornia law also provides that individuals who experience sexual violence are\nencouraged to preserve evidence and to note the identity and location of Witnesses.\nContacting law enfo",

For more information about how to obtain a SART exam, see:\nhttps://equity.stanford.edu/sexual-violence-support/urgent-help/forensic-evidence-collection\n(https://equity.stanford.edu/sexual-violence-support/urgent-help/forensic-evidence-\ncollection).\nSupportive Measures are available with or without filing a complaint and regardless of\nwhether the university has jurisdiction over an alleged incident. Supportive Measures will\nbe different for every matter and will be based on individualized review. Stanford offers\nconfidential counseling to community members, through the Confidential Support Team for\nstudents, and through the Faculty/Staff HELP Center for others. Other Supportive\nMeasures may include extensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments,\nmodifications of work or class schedules, campus escort services, mutual restrictions on\ncontact between the Parties, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of absence,\nincreased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus, and other similar\nmeasures. The Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE or Deputy Title IX Coordinator is\nresponsible for coordinating the effective implementation of Supportive Measures. The Title\nIX Coordinator/Director of SHARE or Deputy Title IX Coordinator will consider the\nComplainant’s wishes with respect to Supportive Measures.\n4. Reporting Prohibited Sexual Conduct or other Policy\nViolations\nAll reports of Prohibited Sexual Conduct or other violations of this Policy should be reported to\nthe Stanford Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE at Kingscote Gardens, Suite 240, 419\nLagunita Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, titleix@stanford.edu (mailto:titleix@stanford.edu), (650)\n497-4955.\nAny person may report violations of this Policy (whether or not the individual reporting is the\nperson alleged to be the victim of the Policy violation), in person, by mail, by telephone, or by\nemail,[10] (#_ftn10) using the contact information listed above. Such a report may be made at\nany time, including during non-business hours, by using the telephone number or email address,\nor by mail to the office address, listed for the Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE.\nFor reports of violations under this Policy, the following information (if known) should be provided\nto the SHARE Title IX Office:\nName of Complainant\nComplainant’s role within the university (undergraduate student, graduate student, faculty,\nstaff, postdoctoral scholar, fellow, alumni, other [describe])\nName of Respondent\nRespondent’s role within the university (undergraduate student, graduate student, faculty,\nstaff, postdoctoral scholar, fellow)\nDate of the incident\nLocation of the incident\nTime of the incident\nNature of the conduct (that is, provide specific details of the report)\nDate of previous report (if any)\nTo whom any previous report was made (if any)\nDuty to Report\nExcept for University-recognized Confidential Resources (defined below), the following University\nstaff members with knowledge of unreported concerns relating to violations of this Policy are\nconsidered Responsible Employees and are required to promptly report such allegations to the\nTitle IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE:\nFaculty;\nSupervisors and Managers;\nHuman Resources representatives;\nPrincipal Investigators/Lab Directors or Coordinators;\nStaff within:\nUniversity Human Resources and Employee & Labor Relations;\nResidential Education (including RAs and CAs, acting in their capacities as student\nstaff members);\nVice Provost for Student Affairs;\nVice Provost for Undergraduate Education;\nVice Provost for Graduate Education; and\n(Except the Ombuds) Institutional Equity and Access; and\nStaff who have responsibility for working with students in the following capacities:\nTeaching, including lecturers, instructors, and student instructors/teaching\nassistants/course assistants acting in their teaching capacities);\nadvising;\ncoaching or mentoring;\ncareer development or internship/externship programs; or\noverseas studies/study abroad.\nThese individuals are required to report the information received to the Title IX\nCoordinator/Director of SHARE, regardless of whether the person who is the subject of the\nPolicy violation has or has not indicated they will contact the appropriate office.\nSeparate from the above, notice of a report of Prohibited Sexual Conduct to the following\nindividuals constitutes actual notice triggering the University’s obligations under Title IX:\nTitle IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE\nDeputy Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE\nOther Senior Leaders\nPresident\nProvost\nDeans of Schools\nDirector of Athletics (DAPER)\nVice Presidents\nVice Provosts\nExternal Reports\nCertain Prohibited Sexual Conduct may also violate state and federal law. In addition to the\ninternal resources just described, individuals may pursue complaints directly with the government\nagencies that deal with unlawful harassment and discrimination claims, e.g., the U.S. Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) (http://www.eeoc.gov/), the Office for Civil Rights\n(OCR) of the U.S. Department of Education (http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/index.html),\nand the State of California Civil Rights Department (CRD) (https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/).\nPlease note that a violation of this policy may exist even where the conduct in question does not\nviolate the law.\n5. Privacy and Confidentiality\nFor the purpose of this Policy, Privacy and Confidentiality have distinct meanings.\nPrivacy means that information related to a complaint will be shared with a limited number\nof University employees who “need to know” in order to assist in the assessment,\ninvestigation, and resolution of the report. All employees who are responsible for the\nUniversity’s response to violations of this Policy receive specific training and guidance\nabout sharing and safeguarding private information in accordance with state and federal\nlaw. The privacy of student education records will be protected in accordance with the\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), and the privacy of employee records\nwill be protected in accordance with California law and University policy.\nConfidentiality exists in the context of laws that protect certain relationships, including\nthose who provide services related to medical and clinical care, mental health providers,\ncounselors, and ordained clergy. The law creates a privilege between certain health care\nproviders, mental health care providers, attorneys, clergy, spouses, and others, with their\npatients, clients, parishioners, and spouses. The University has designated individuals who\nhave the ability to have privileged communications as Confidential Resources.\nThe University will make reasonable and appropriate efforts to preserve an individual’s Privacy\nand to protect the Confidentiality of information. However, because of laws relating to reporting\nand other state and federal laws, the University cannot guarantee Confidentiality relating to\nincidents of Prohibited Sexual Conduct except where those reports are privileged\ncommunications to Confidential Resources. Even then, there are exceptions to maintaining\nConfidentiality set by law; for example, physicians and nurses who treat any physical injury\nsustained during a sexual assault are required to report it to law enforcement. Also, physicians,\nnurses, psychologists, psychiatrists, teachers and social workers must report a sexual assault\ncommitted against a person under age 18.[11] (#_ftn11)\nExcept for Confidential Resources, information shared with other individuals is not legally\nprotected from being disclosed.

The University in such circumstances will make sure the Complainant is\naware their/they are protected from Retaliation.\nReports to Law Enforcement and Required Notifications\nAs required by the Clery Act, all disclosures to any University employee of an on-campus or\n“non-campus property” sexual assault must be reported for statistical purposes only (without\npersonal identifiers) to the Stanford University Department of Public Safety, which has the\nresponsibility for tabulating and annually publishing sexual assault and other crime statistics. To\npromote public safety, the Department also alerts the campus community to incidents and trends\nof immediate concern.\nWhen the allegations described could be a crime under California law,[12] (#_ftn12) University\nstaff members designated as Campus Security Authorities (https://police.stanford.edu/security-\nreport.html) are also required by California law to notify the Stanford University Department of\nPublic Safety. Under California law, violent crimes, including sexual assault, and hate crimes\nmust be reported immediately by calling 9-1-1 or 650-329-2413. Campus security Authorities can\nreport other crimes at https://police.stanford.edu/pdf/CSA-Report-Form.pdf\n(https://police.stanford.edu/pdf/CSA-Report-Form.pdf). (For more information see:\nhttps://police.stanford.edu/pdf/CSA-Flowchart.pdf (https://police.stanford.edu/pdf/CSA-\nFlowchart.pdf)).\nExcept in the event the person who is the subject of the potential criminal act is a minor, the\nname of this individual should not be released to the Department of Public Safety without the\nComplainant’s consent.\nIn California, a police officer is required to ask a victim of sexual assault and domestic violence\n(specifically section 273.5 Penal Code) if they want their name to remain confidential (Penal\nCode 293(a)). If a victim elects to have their name remain confidential, the police will not list the\nvictim's name in a crime log or release it to University officials without permission (Penal Code\n293(d)). If the District Attorney elects to prosecute a sexual assault, the name of an adult victim\nmay be subject to disclosure.\nConsultation/Confidential Resources\nThe University makes available Confidential Resources for consultation regarding reports of\nviolations of this Policy or other conduct, whether or not a Policy violation has actually occurred\nor the person seeking information is a Complainant, a person who believes their own actions\nmay be the subject of criticism (even if unwarranted), or a third party. Often there is a desire that\na consultation be confidential or “off the record.” This can usually be achieved when individuals\ndiscuss conduct without identifying the other persons involved, and sometimes even without\nidentifying themselves. However, when a name or details sufficient to identify an individual\nare provided to a Responsible Employee (defined above), a consultation can no longer be\nconsidered “off the record” and then needs to be reported. Confidential Resources, by\ncontrast, are not required to report to or share any information with the University. Confidential\nResources do not disclose information received by them with any other office or person,\nincluding the SHARE Title IX office, and therefore meeting with a Confidential Resource will\nnever lead to a University response or Investigation. However, Confidentiality does not extend to\nreasonable belief that a minor (under age 18) has been harmed or is at risk of being harmed,\nwhich by law must be reported to law enforcement or child protective services. [13] (#_ftn13)\nSimilarly, if a client, or a close relation of the client, makes a specific threat of planning to kill or\nseriously harm another person to a Confidential counselor, this also requires a report to law\nenforcement. In addition, the University cannot guarantee that conversations with the Ombuds or\na dean at the Office for Religious Life at Memorial Church might not be subject to disclosure in\nlegal proceedings or pursuant to other legal process. Communications with attorneys, medical\ndoctors, and mental health care providers, on the other hand, may be privileged under law.\nThe University’s Confidential Resources and Confidential community resources can be found at\nhttps://titleix.stanford.edu/confidential-counseling-university-resources\n(https://titleix.stanford.edu/confidential-counseling-university-resources).\n6. Required Prevention Education/Training Programs\nFor Faculty, Staff and Postdoctoral Scholars\nIn compliance with California Government Code Section 12950.1, all supervisors (including\nfaculty) who are employed by Stanford are required to participate in a minimum 2-hour sexual\nharassment training at least every two years. Other topics covered by this program include illegal\ndiscrimination, abusive behavior in the workplace, forms of sexual violence, how to be an active\n“upstander,” supervisor’s responsibility to report and how to appropriately respond to reports of\nProhibited Sexual Conduct within the student and staff communities.\nFurther, Stanford requires non-supervisory employees to participate in a minimum 1-hour sexual\nharassment prevention training at least every two years. All new employees who are not faculty\nand who do not supervise other workers will be provided Harassment Prevention Training for\nNon-Supervisory Employees generally within six months of hire. Temporary and casual\nemployees will generally be provided training within 30 calendar days of the date of hire.\nParticipants will learn how to recognize sexual misconduct in the workplace and about campus\nresources. Other topics covered by this program include illegal discrimination, abusive behavior\nin the workplace, forms of sexual violence, how to be an active “upstander,” and how to report\nand appropriately respond to reports of sexual violence or harassment within the student and\nstaff communities.\nFailure to complete assigned prevention education programming/training may result in corrective\naction.\nFor Students\nStanford requires all incoming students, graduates and undergraduates, to complete prevention\neducation programming prior to enrolling at Stanford, generally through an assigned online\ncourse. Additionally, undergraduates are expected to participate in additional programming on\ncampus, or virtually. The university or departments may require additional programming for\nstudents, such as student athletes, or students participating in Greek life. Failure to complete\nassigned prevention education programming can result in an enrollment hold.\nStudent staff and student teaching assistants are required to complete additional training in order\nto fulfill their student staff or teaching responsibilities. Failure to complete the training can result\nin termination from the role.\n7. Sanctions\nViolations under this Policy are extremely serious and decision-makers are expected to impose\nappropriate discipline, University interventions, or remedial or corrective actions for each matter\nup to and including discharge (for faculty, staff, or other employees), expulsion (for students),\nremoval from campus, and/or other appropriate sanctions or actions. Depending on the\ncircumstances, Respondents may be removed from University programs, placed on\nadministrative leave, and/or removed from campus pending the finding of responsibility for a\nviolation of this Policy.\n8.

Procedures for Policy Violations\nThe University has several procedures available to resolve allegations of violations of this Policy.\nIn general, the University will investigate or otherwise respond to reports of violations of this\nPolicy in circumstances in which either:\nBoth the Respondent and the Complainant are subject to this Policy and there is a\nconnection between the allegations and University programs or activities; OR\nThe Respondent is subject to this Policy and investigation and response are necessary for\nthe proper functioning of the University, including the safety of members of the University\ncommunity or preservation of a respectful and safe climate at the University. \nWhich procedure the University will use to investigate and resolve a violation of this Policy\ndepends on the circumstances of the report, including the respective roles of the Complainant\nand Respondent at the University, the location of the alleged Policy violation and relationship to\nUniversity programs or activities, and the severity of the alleged conduct. More information about\navailable procedures can be found at https://titleix.stanford.edu/investigationgrievance-\nadministrative-policy-and-procedures (https://titleix.stanford.edu/investigationgrievance-\nadministrative-policy-and-procedures).  \nProcedures specific to Employment-Related Sexual Harassment are as follows:\nProcedures for Employment-Related Sexual Harassment\nUniversity Intervention\nDepending on the circumstances and taking into account a Complainant’s request for\nConfidentiality, a University Intervention in the workplace or academic setting may be attempted.\nThe Intervention may be led by Human Resources professionals, Title IX staff members, the\nOmbuds, other faculty or staff, or sometimes an outside party unrelated to the University. An\nIntervention is an action to address a concern without a formal investigation. This process is\nappropriate when the allegation, if true, would not rise to the level of a Policy violation, but the\nconduct is nonetheless objectionable. Examples of this conduct could include inappropriate jokes\nand comments. This process is also appropriate when the Complainant does not want the\nUniversity to conduct a full investigation and the University considers an intervention an\nappropriate step to address the concerns. The goal is to address the reported behavior to the\nextent possible while honoring the wishes of the Complainant.\nIn addition, in the event the person who is the subject of the Policy violation decides not to\nsubmit a complaint, the University, consistent with its obligations under California and federal\nlaw, reserves the discretion to take prompt, remedial action upon the receipt of notice of a\npotential Policy violation to cause any harassing behavior to stop. \nInvestigations\nIf significant facts are contested, a prompt investigation may be undertaken. The investigation\nwill be conducted by impartial and trained personnel in a way that respects, to the reasonable\nextent possible bearing in mind the safety of the campus community, the privacy of all of the\npersons involved. In appropriate cases, internal or external professional investigators may be\nasked to conduct or assist in the investigation. In making a finding, the investigator will use the\n“Preponderance of the Evidence” standard: is it more likely than not that the reported allegations\nare true. The University will strive to complete investigations as expeditiously as possible. The\nresults of the investigation may be used in the third party intervention process or in a grievance\nor disciplinary action.\nDisciplinary Procedures, Grievances and/or Appeals\nIn appropriate cases, disciplinary procedures may be initiated. The applicable disciplinary\nprocedure depends on the status of the individual whose conduct is in question (the\nRespondent).\nDepending upon the nature of the remedial or corrective action imposed, the Respondent may\nbe able to appeal or grieve the disciplinary result. The applicable appeal/grievance procedure\ndepends on the circumstances and the position of the Respondent. Generally, the process\nconsists of the individual's submission of a complaint, a fact-finding process or investigation by a\nUniversity representative, followed by a decision and, in some cases, the possibility of one or\nmore appeals, usually to Stanford administrative officers at higher levels.\nIndemnification and Costs\nThe question sometimes arises as to whether the University will defend and indemnify a Stanford\nemployee accused of sexual harassment. California law provides, in part, \"An employer shall\nindemnify [its] employee for all that the employee necessarily expends or loses in direct\nconsequence of the discharge of their duties as such...\" The issue of indemnification depends on\nthe facts and circumstances of each situation. Individuals who violate this policy, however, should\nbe aware that they and/or their schools, institutes, or other units may be required to pay or\ncontribute to any judgments, costs and expenses incurred as a result of behavior that is wrongful\nand/or contrary to the discharge of the employee's duties. In general, see Administrative Guide\nMemo 2.4.6 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/employment-general-\ninformation/indemnification).\nRecordkeeping\nThe SHARE Title IX Office will track reports of Employment-Related Sexual Harassment for\nstatistical purposes and report at least annually concerning their number, nature and disposition\nto the University President through the Provost. University decision-makers have a responsibility\nto keep the SHARE Title IX Office informed about the outcome of cases.\nThe SHARE Title IX Office may keep confidential records of reports of Employment-Related\nSexual Harassment and the actions taken in response to those reports and use them for\npurposes such as to identify individuals or departments likely to benefit from training so that\ntraining priorities can be established.\n \nPolicy Footnotes\n[1] This Policy is also designed to comply with the Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA”) (42\nU.S.C. 13925) and its implementing regulations (24 C.F.R. 5.2001) if reauthorized.\n[2] Section 106.30(a) of the Title IX regulations provides that \"sexual assault\" for purposes of\nTitle IX is defined in 20 U.S.C. 1092(f)(6)(A)(v), which in turn provides that \"[t]he term ‘sexual\nassault’ means an offense classified as a forcible or nonforcible sex offense under the uniform\ncrime reporting system of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\" The definitions for forcible and\nnonforcible sex offenses are derived from the FBI’s Summary Reporting System and/or National\nIncident-Based Reporting System. On August 13, 2020, OCR provided guidance that a university\nmay use definitions from either system, so long as the university includes in its definition of\nsexual assault all forcible and nonforcible sex offenses described by the FBI—regardless of\nwhether the FBI system uses the label forcible or nonforcible or requires force as an element.\nConsistent with this guidance, Stanford has elected to use the definitions from each system that\nprovide the most flexibility and that do not use the requirement of force as an element. Stanford\nhas also made slight, non-substantive modifications to the FBI definitions for clarity and\nconsistency with defined terms used within this Policy, such as \"Complainant,\" \"Affirmative\nConsent,\" and \"Incapacitation.\"\n[3] The following sexual acts covered by this definition are required to be included by federal\nregulations and are derived from the FBI’s Summary Reporting System and National Incident-\nBased Reporting System User Manual definitions:\nRape.

    "text": "1.7.2 Consensual Sexual or Romantic\nRelationships In the Workplace and\nEducational Setting\nAuthority\nApproved by the President.\nLast Updated\nNovember 21, 2017\nEffective Date\nDecember 6, 2013\nThis policy highlights the risks in sexual or romantic relationships in the Stanford workplace or\nacademic setting between individuals in inherently unequal positions; prohibits certain\nrelationships between teachers and students; and requires recusal (from supervision and\nevaluation) and notification in other relationships.\nApplicability: Applies to all students, faculty, staff, and others who participate in Stanford\nprograms and activities.\n1. In General\nThere are special risks in any sexual or romantic relationship between individuals in inherently\nunequal positions, and parties in such a relationship assume those risks. In the university\ncontext, such positions include (but are not limited to) teacher and student, supervisor and\nemployee, senior faculty and junior faculty, mentor and trainee, adviser and advisee, teaching\nassistant and student, principal investigator and postdoctoral scholar or research assistant,\ncoach and athlete, attending physician and resident or fellow, and individuals who supervise the\nday-to-day student living environment and their students.\nBecause of the potential for conflict of interest, exploitation, favoritism, and bias, such\nrelationships may undermine the real or perceived integrity of the supervision and evaluation\nprovided. Further, these relationships are often less consensual than the individual whose\nposition confers power or authority believes. In addition, circumstances may change, and\nconduct that was previously welcome may become unwelcome. Even when both parties have\nconsented at the outset to a sexual or romantic involvement, this past consent does not remove\ngrounds for a charge based upon subsequent unwelcome conduct.\nSuch relationships may also have unintended, adverse effects on the climate of an academic\nprogram or work unit, thereby impairing the learning or working environment for others – both\nduring such a relationship and after any break-up. Relationships in which one party is in a\nposition to evaluate the work or influence the career of the other may provide grounds for\ncomplaint by third parties when that relationship gives undue access or advantage, restricts\nopportunities, or simply creates a perception of these problems. Additionally, even when a\nrelationship ends, there may be bias (even if unintentional) for or against the former partner, or\nthere could be an ongoing impression of such bias; in other words, the effects of a romantic or\nsexual relationship can extend beyond the relationship itself.  \nFor all of these reasons, sexual or romantic relationships--whether regarded as\nconsensual or otherwise--between individuals in inherently unequal positions should in\ngeneral be avoided and in many circumstances are strictly prohibited by this policy. Since\nthese relationships can occur in multiple contexts on campus, this policy addresses certain\ncontexts specifically. However, the policy covers all sexual and romantic relationships involving\nindividuals in unequal positions, even if not addressed explicitly in what follows.\n2. With Students\nAt a university, the role of the teacher is multifaceted, including serving as intellectual guide,\nmentor, role model and advisor. This role is at the heart of the University’s educational mission\nand its integrity must be maintained. The teacher’s influence and authority can extend far beyond\nthe classroom and into the future, affecting the academic progress and careers of our students.\nAccordingly, the University expects teachers to maintain interactions with students free from\ninfluences that may interfere with the learning and personal development experiences to which\nstudents are entitled. In this context, teachers include those who are entrusted by Stanford to\nteach, supervise, mentor and coach students, including faculty and consulting faculty of all ranks,\nlecturers, academic advisors, and principal investigators.  The specific policies on teachers\noutlined below do not apply to Stanford students (undergraduates, graduates and post-doctoral\nscholars) who may at times take on the role of teachers or teaching assistants, policies for whom\nare addressed in a separate section.\nAs a general proposition, the University believes that a sexual or romantic relationship between a\nteacher and a student – even where consensual and whether or not the student is subject to\nsupervision or evaluation by the teacher – is inconsistent with the proper role of the teacher.  Not\nonly can these relationships harm the educational environment for the individual student\ninvolved, they also undermine the educational environment for other students. Furthermore, such\nrelationships may expose the teacher to charges of misconduct and create a potential liability,\nnot only for the teacher, but also for the University if it is determined that laws against sexual\nharassment or discrimination have been violated.\nConsequently, the University has established the following parameters regarding sexual or\nromantic relationships with Stanford students:\nFirst, because of the relative youth of undergraduates and their particular vulnerability in such\nrelationships, sexual or romantic relationships between teachers and undergraduate\nstudents are prohibited – regardless of current or future academic or supervisory\nresponsibilities for that student.   \nSecond, whenever a teacher has, has had, or in the future might reasonably be expected\nto have, academic responsibility over any student, such relationships are prohibited. This\nincludes, for example, any faculty member who teaches in a graduate student’s department,\nprogram or division.  Conversely, no teacher shall exercise academic responsibility over a\nstudent with whom the teacher has or has previously had a sexual or romantic relationship.\n“Academic responsibility” includes (but is not limited to) teaching, grading, mentoring, advising on\nor evaluating research or other academic activity, participating in decisions regarding funding or\nother resources, clinical supervision, and recommending for admissions, employment,\nfellowships or awards.  In this context, students include graduate and professional school\nstudents, postdoctoral scholars, and clinical residents or fellows.\nThird, certain staff roles (including deans and other senior administrators, coaches, supervisors\nof student employees, Residence Deans and Fellows, as well as others who mentor, advise or\nhave authority over students) also have broad influence on or authority over students and their\nexperience at Stanford. For this reason, sexual or romantic relationships between such staff\nmembers and undergraduate students are prohibited. Similarly, relationships between staff\nmembers and other students over whom the staff member has had or is likely in the future to\nhave such influence or authority are prohibited.\nWhen a preexisting sexual or romantic relationship between a university employee and a student\nis prohibited by this policy – or if a relationship not previously prohibited becomes prohibited due\nto a change in circumstances – the employee must both recuse himself or herself from any\nsupervisory or academic responsibility over the student, and notify their supervisor, department\nchair or dean about the situation so that adequate alternative supervisory or evaluative\narrangements can be put in place. This obligation to recuse and notify exists for past as well as\nfor current relationships. Failure to disclose the relationship in a timely fashion will itself be\nconsidered a violation of policy. The university understands that sexual or romantic relationships\nare often private in nature and the university treats such information sensitively and (to the extent\npracticable) confidentially.\n3.

    "text": "and the university treats such information sensitively and (to the extent\npracticable) confidentially.\n3. Between Students (Student Teachers, Teaching\nAssistants and Graders)\nMany existing policies govern student responsibilities towards each other.  The current policy\napplies when undergraduate or graduate students or post-doctoral scholars are serving in the\nteaching role as teachers, TAs, graders or research supervisors. The policy does not prohibit\nstudents from having consensual sexual or romantic relationships with fellow students. However,\nif such a relationship exists between a student teacher and a student in a setting for which the\nstudent teacher is serving in this capacity, s/he shall not exercise any evaluative or teaching\nfunction for that student. Furthermore, the student teacher must recuse himself or herself\nand notify their supervisor so that alternative evaluative, oversight or teaching\narrangements can be put in place. This obligation to recuse and notify exists for past as well\nas for current relationships. Failure to notify and recuse in this situation will be subject to\ndiscipline under the Fundamental Standard.  The university understands that sexual or romantic\nrelationships are often private in nature and the university treats such information sensitively and\n(to the extent practicable) confidentially.\n4. In Other Contexts\nConsensual sexual or romantic relationships between adult employees (including faculty) are not\nin general prohibited by this policy. However, relationships between employees in which one has\ndirect or indirect authority over the other are always potentially problematic. This includes not\nonly relationships between supervisors and their staff, but also between senior faculty and junior\nfaculty, faculty and both academic and non-academic staff, and so forth.\nWhere such a relationship develops, the person in the position of greater authority or power must\nrecuse him/herself to ensure that their does not exercise any supervisory or evaluative function\nover the other person in the relationship. Where such recusal is required, the recusing party must\nalso notify their supervisor, department chair, dean or human resources manager, so that person\ncan ensure adequate alternative supervisory or evaluative arrangements are put in place. Such\nnotification is always required where recusal is required. This obligation to recuse and notify\nexists for past as well as for current relationships. Failure to disclose the relationship in a timely\nfashion will itself be considered a violation of policy. The university understands that sexual or\nromantic relationships are often private in nature and the university treats such information\nsensitively and (to the extent practicable) confidentially.\nThe University has the option to take any action necessary to ensure compliance with the spirit of\nthis policy, including transferring either or both employees to minimize disruption of the work\ngroup.\n5. Additional Matters\nIf there is any doubt whether a relationship falls within this policy, individuals should disclose the\nfacts and seek guidance rather than fail to disclose. Questions may be addressed to your\nsupervisor or cognizant dean or to the SHARE Title IX Office, or in confidence to the University\nOmbuds or the School of Medicine Ombuds. In those rare situations where it is programmatically\ninfeasible to provide alternative supervision, academic responsibility and/or evaluation, the\ncognizant dean, director or supervisor must approve all (as applicable) academic responsibility,\nevaluative and compensation actions.Employees who engage in sexual or romantic relationships\nwith a student or other employee contrary to the guidance, prohibitions and requirements\nprovided in the policy are subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal, depending\non the nature of and context for the violation. They will also be held accountable for any adverse\nconsequences that result from those relationships.\nStanford’s policy with regard to employment of related persons can be found in the\nAdministrative Guide 2.1.2.2c and is excerpted here:\nEmployment by a related person in any position (e.g. regular staff, faculty, other teaching,\ntemporary, casual, third party, etc.) within an organizational unit can occur only with the approval\nof the responsible Vice Provost, Vice President (or similar level equivalent to the highest\nadministrative person within the organizational unit), or their designee. Under no circumstances\nmay a supervisor hire or approve any compensation action for any employee to whom the\nsupervisor is related. An individual may not supervise, evaluate the job performance, or approve\ncompensation for any individual with whom the supervisor is related.Even when the criteria\ndiscussed here are met, employment of a related person in any position within the organization\nmust have the approval of the local human resources office, in addition to the approval of the\nhiring manager's supervisor, including faculty supervisors. \n6. Policy Review and Evaluation\nThis policy was originally part of the Sexual Harassment policy, which went into effect on October\n6, 1993, and was amended November 30, 1995, May 30, 2002, August 30, 2012 and June 11,\n2013. Its revision and conversion to a separate policy was made on December 6, 2013 and\nupdated on January 21, 2014. Comments or suggestions should be made to the Provost.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-\nprinciples/harassment-discrimination/consensual-sexual-or-romantic",

Its application\nincludes Stanford programs and activities both on and off-campus, including overseas programs.\n1. Equal Employment Opportunity\nIt is the policy of Stanford University to provide equal employment opportunities for all applicants\nand employees in compliance with all applicable laws. This policy applies in all aspects of the\nemployment relationship including (but not limited to) recruiting, selection, placement,\nsupervision, working conditions, compensation, training, promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff,\nand termination. All university personnel policies, procedures, and practices must be\nadministered consistent with the intent of this policy.\n2. Protection against Discrimination\n(a)\nStanford University does not discriminate on the basis of race, religious creed, color, national\norigin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, reproductive health decision-making, medical\ncondition, genetic information, marital status, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender\nidentity, gender expression, military status, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected\nby law, in connection with any aspect of employment at Stanford.\n(b)\nHarassment on the basis of any legally protected characteristic is a form of discrimination and is\nlikewise prohibited by this university policy. Prohibited harassment occurs if a hostile\nenvironment has been created that is sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to\nunreasonably interfere with a person's work performance or participation in university activities.\nProhibited harassment may take the form of (but is not limited to) offensive slurs, jokes, and\nother offensive oral, written, computer-generated, visual or physical conduct which is aimed at an\nindividual or group because of their protected status.\n3. Affirmative Action\nAs a matter of institutional policy and consistent with its obligation as a federal government\ncontractor, Stanford University is committed to principles of diversity and affirmative action, and\nwill comply with all affirmative action requirements in accordance with law.\n4. Internal Reporting and Resources\nThe university encourages any person who believes that they have been discriminated against or\nharassed in violation of this policy, or observes or is otherwise aware of an incident of\ndiscrimination or harassment, to report the incident promptly.\nEmployees have various options to report discrimination and harassment and are not required to\ncomplain directly to their supervisor.  However, a supervisor or manager who receives a\ncomplaint of discrimination or harassment, or observes or is otherwise aware of an incident of\ndiscrimination or harassment, is required to inform the appropriate university office, as set forth\nbelow.\nMaking a false report or providing false information may be grounds for discipline in the absence\nof a good faith belief that the report/information is true.\n(a) Staff or Applicants (including complaints against staff)\nComplaints of discrimination, harassment and/or retaliation in violation of this policy can be made\nto:\nUniversity Human Resources, Employee & Labor Relations, at stanfordelr@stanford.edu\n(mailto:stanfordelr@stanford.edu) or 650-721-4272.\nComplaints can also be made to any of the following:\nA supervisor/manager\nThe local Human Resources office\nThe SHARE Title IX Office at titleix@stanford.edu (mailto:titleix@stanford.edu) or 650-497-\n4955, for concerns regarding sexual harassment\nAnonymously through the Ethics and Compliance Helpline (https://ocro.stanford.edu/ethics-\ncompliance/ethics-compliance-helpline)\nAny individual or office who receives a concern about discrimination or harassment relating to\nstaff or applicants should report the concern to University Human Resources, Employee & Labor\nRelations at stanfordelr@stanford.edu (mailto:stanfordelr@stanford.edu) or 650-721-4272.\n(b) Faculty\nComplaints of discrimination, harassment and/or retaliation relating to faculty in violation of this\npolicy can be made to the applicable school dean’s office.\nComplaints can also be made to any of the following:\nThe SHARE Title IX Office at titleix@stanford.edu (mailto:titleix@stanford.edu) or 650-497-\n4955, for concerns regarding sexual harassment\nAnonymously through the Ethics and Compliance Helpline (https://ocro.stanford.edu/ethics-\ncompliance/ethics-compliance-helpline)\n \n(c) Additional Resources\nAdditional resources provide support and assistance to faculty and staff. Discussion of concerns\nwith the following offices will not constitute “notice” to university[1] (#_ftn1), nor will it create a\nrecord of the concerns with the university:\nThe University Ombuds (https://ombuds.stanford.edu/) at 650-497-1542,\nThe School of Medicine Ombuds (http://med.stanford.edu/ombuds/) at 650-498-5744,\nThe Faculty Staff Help Center (http://helpcenter.stanford.edu/) at 650-723-4577, and\nThe Office for Religious & Spiritual Life (https://orsl.stanford.edu/) at (650) 723-1762.\n[1] Unless under limited circumstances.

Investigations are conducted as necessary by\nimpartial and qualified personnel and will reach conclusions based on the evidence collected.\nUnless otherwise required by law, the guideline for investigations to conclude is 90 days;\nhowever, this timeline may be extended in some cases, such as complex matters or where there\nare unforeseen circumstances. Personnel conducting investigations will document and track\ninvestigations for reasonable progress and timely closures. If inappropriate conduct or\nmisconduct is found, appropriate corrective and/or disciplinary action will be taken. All individuals\ncovered by this policy are expected to fully and truthfully cooperate in the investigation of any\nclaim of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. Failure to cooperate and/or be truthful in an\ninvestigation when requested may be grounds for discipline.\nDepending upon an individual's category of employment (e.g., faculty, academic staff, regular\nstaff, postdoctoral scholar, etc.) and the nature of the complaint, applicable grievance or other\nprocedures (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/working-stanford/address-\nconcerns/grievanceappeal-processes) also may be used to report complaints or to appeal\nfindings of an investigation.\n6. Confidentiality\nThe university recognizes the importance of confidentiality.  Personnel responsible for\nimplementing this policy will respect the confidentiality and privacy of individuals reporting or\naccused of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation to the extent reasonably possible.\nExamples of situations where confidentiality cannot be maintained include circumstances when\nthe law requires disclosure of information and/or when disclosure by the university is necessary\nto protect the safety of others.\n7. Protection Against Retaliation\nStanford University policy prohibits retaliation against individuals who raise concerns of\nperceived discrimination or harassment or who participate in the investigation of any claim of\ndiscrimination or harassment. Retaliation is any materially adverse action that would dissuade a\nreasonable person from making or supporting a claim of harassment or discrimination.\nRetaliation violates the law and S",

This includes\nathletic camps, academic camps, licensed child care facilities, instructional programs, and any\nother organized activities intended for Minors. This policy applies whether the activities are\nlimited to daytime, involve overnight stays in residence halls, take place online, or occur off-\ncampus under Stanford's direction or sponsorship. \n1. Definitions\n“Minor”: Anyone under the age of 18.\n“Covered Program”: Any activity directed or sponsored by Stanford intended for Minors,\nwhether in-person or online. This also includes programs and activities run by third parties\non Stanford’s campus. It does not include public events not specifically for Minors, events\nattended by Minors with their parents/guardians, or school trips where Minors are\nsupervised by authorized adults.\n“Program Staff”: Administrators, faculty, staff, students, and volunteers who work directly\nwith, supervise, chaperone, or oversee Minors in Covered Programs.\n“Live Scan”: The required method for conducting criminal background checks for Program\nStaff working with Minors. This involves fingerprinting and must include results from both\nthe California Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. For details on\nLive Scan background checks, see the Protection of Minors website\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/workplace-essentials/policies/protection-minors/policy-\nrequirements/program-staff).\n2. Purpose and Scope of Policy\na) Stanford University is dedicated to the safety and welfare of all individuals participating in\nuniversity-sponsored events. Because Minors are particularly vulnerable, the university\nimplements extra safety measures to protect Minors when participating in Covered Programs.\nThis policy outlines Program Staff responsibilities and reminds all university community members\nto immediately report any inappropriate behavior involving Minors. Not complying with these\nrequirements can lead to corrective action, including termination and/or loss of privileges to use\nStanford facilities.\nb) The policy requirements do not apply to:\nMatriculated Stanford students who are Minors.\nMinors who are employed at Stanford. If a Minor employee will be working in a Covered\nProgram, they must complete a Live Scan background check and required training.\nMinors participating in Institutional Review Board-approved research.\nPatient care-related activities involving Minors at Stanford Hospital or Lucile Packard\nChildren’s Hospital.\nc) The background check and training requirements do not apply to events lasting one day or\nless. These events must be registered with University Human Resources, have sufficient adult\nsupervision, and adhere to Stanford's Guidelines for Appropriate Behavior with Minors\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/workplace-essentials/policies/protection-\nminors/guidelines/guidelines-appropriate-behavior-minors). At least one adult Program Staff with\na current background check must be present during these events.\nd) Requests for exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Vice President for Human\nResources or their designee.\n3.  Minors Not Participating in University-Sponsored\nActivities\na) Generally, Stanford is not a suitable place for Minors unless they are participating in an\napproved program.\n1. If Stanford students have a Minor guest staying with them on campus, the Minor must\nfollow the Guest Policy in the Stanford student’s Residence Agreement. Minor guests must\nbe accompanied in the residence by their host and be registered with the Housing Service\nCenter.\n2. Daycare or babysitting services are only allowed if provided by a Stanford NAEYC-\naccredited Early Education and Childcare center or a licensed child care vendor authorized\nby Stanford. In-home child care in private residences located on Stanford property is\npermitted.\n3. Some areas are restricted for Minors by university policy or law. If a parent or guardian\nbrings a Minor to work, they are responsible for the Minor’s safety and must keep them\naway from restricted areas.\nb) Minors should not be left unsupervised on campus. Anyone bringing Minors to campus must\nensure they are appropriately supervised. Some high school-aged programs may allow limited\nunsupervised time on campus, with parental approval and subject to program rules.\n4. Requirements for Sponsoring Covered Programs\na) Register the Program\n1. Each Covered Program must have a Stanford department identified as the Program\nSponsor, represented by a Department Chair, Senior Staff\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-2/subchapter-1/policy-2-1-14), or Institute\nDirector. Eligible Program Sponsors include Stanford academic departments,\nadministrative offices, and non-academic departments recognized by the President's\nOffice.\n2. Third-party programs must obtain approval through University Human Resources.\n3. The Program Sponsor must register the program with University Human Resources using\nthe Protection of Minors Management System (ePOM), providing necessary program\ndetails such as description, dates, location, expected age range, and estimated number of\nMinors. For more information, visit the Protection of Minors website\n(http://protectminors.stanford.edu/). For third-party programs, once approved, University\nHuman Resources will register the program in ePOM.\n4. Once the program is registered, the Program Sponsor must submit planned Program Staff\nnames and contact details in advance to complete necessary background checks and\ntraining in time for the program.\n5. Program Sponsors must also obtain medical and emergency contact information and\nliability waivers from each Minor's parent/guardian before participation. Liability waivers are\nsubmitted to the Protection of Minors Management System. Medical forms must be kept\nsecurely by the Program Sponsor. Medical forms are not necessary for online-only\nprograms. \nb) Live Scan Background Check Requirements \n1. All Program Staff must complete a Live Scan background check before working with\nMinors, unless exempted under this policy. Third-party programs must ensure their staff\nhave current Live Scan background checks and inform Stanford of any significant criminal\nrecords.\n2. Guest speakers who participate in a Covered Program for only one day and do not\nsupervise Minors are not required to complete a Live Scan background check. However,\nthey must work under the supervision of Program Staff with current Live Scan background\nchecks.\nc) Required Training\n1. All Program Staff, unless exempted under this policy, must receive training before the\nprogram starts on:\nRecognizing signs of sexual abuse, child abuse, and neglect, along with reporting\nobligations.\nAppropriate ratio of adults to Minors.\nAppropriate behavior with Minors.\n2. Training is available online through University Human Resources. For more information,\nsee the Protection of Minors website (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/workplace-\nessentials/policies/protection-minors/policy-requirements/program-staff).\n3. For third-party programs, the organization must ensure all Program Staff receive training on\nthese topics and understand their responsibilities.\n5. Minimum Appropriate Staffing Ratio of Adults to Minors\nAll Covered Programs should, to the greatest extent possible, ensure the presence of two\nMandated Reporters when working directly with or supervising Minors. \nAll in-person Covered Programs must meet the following minimum staffing ratios of adults to\nminors. For example, an in-person Covered Program with 6 day-only participants ages 0-5 years\nmust have a minimum of 2 Program Staff. The ratios below do not apply to online-only programs;\nhowever, Program Staff must adhere to the university’s Guidelines for Online Minors Programs\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanf",

This policy sets forth a framework\ngoverning the assignment of responsibility to individuals throughout the university. It is designed\nto provide the appropriate oversight, accountability, and transparency to ensure that\ncommitments of university resources are executed appropriately and in accord with applicable\nlaws, regulations and university policies. \nAccordingly, this Guide Memo contains policies governing signature and financial approval\nauthority for execution of both financial and non-financial agreements on behalf of the university. \nThis policy applies to all university operations and projects, irrespective of physical location,\nexcept SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford Health Care and Lucile Salter Packard\nChildren's Hospital at Stanford, and their subsidiaries and controlled entities, which are subject to\ntheir own policies.\n1. Key Definitions\na. Signature Authority/Authority to Enter into an Agreement on behalf of the\nUniversity\nSignature authority is a formal delegation that allows an individual to sign or otherwise enter into\nan agreement on behalf of the University.\nDelegated signature authority is required to sign or enter into agreements (which are inclusive of\nany form of written or oral contracts that create any legal obligations for the university, as further\ndescribed below) or otherwise bind or obligate the university to a financial or a non-financial\ncommitment. \nNote that signature authority for many types of agreements is reserved for specific university\noffices. See the Reserved Authority section for additional details.\nb. Financial Approval/PTA Authority\nFinancial approval/PTA authority is a formal delegation that allows an individual to spend or\napprove the commitment of university funds within the scope of their management responsibility,\nsuch as a school, department or administrative unit. Generally, this type of authority is delegated\nwithin the university financial systems (as defined below) and pertains only to the approval of\ntransactions within university financial systems. Financial approval authority does not include\nsignature authority as described above or other reserved authority as described below.\nAdditionally, sufficient financial approval authority is required for all transaction approvals,\nincluding projects that have already received budget approval. An individual may be delegated\nfinancial approval authority for a specific project or initiative by the President or Board of\nTrustees that is greater than their normal financial authority, for example with respect to a large\ncapital project.\nAdministrative Guide Memo 3.2.1: Responsibility for University Funds\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/expenditure-\nmanagement/responsibility-university-funds) further provides that expenditures must be: (1)\nreasonable and necessary; (2) consistent with established university policies and practices\napplicable to the work of the university, including instruction, research, and public service; and\n(3) consistent with sponsor or donor expenditure restrictions.\nc. Exercise of Authority\nIndividuals entering into an agreement on behalf of the university must have signature authority\nthat has been explicitly delegated from the Board of Trustees or via the sub-delegation process\nfrom the President.\nWhen an action is within one’s signature authority delegation, the delegate must exercise sound\nbusiness judgment, including:\nConsultation and coordination with other officers, faculty, staff or other persons who may\nhave overlapping responsibilities\nEnsuring compliance with all relevant university policies and external requirements\nVisit Fingate, the Gateway to Financial Activities website, to learn more about signature versus\nfinancial approval authority (https://fingate.stanford.edu/authority/signature-versus-financial-\napproval-authority) and a list of university contacts available to provide expert assistance.\n2. Scope of Signature and Approval Authority Delegated to\nthe University President\nBy resolution of the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, the President has\nthe general authority, on behalf of the university and its subsidiaries (excluding Stanford Health\nCare, Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital, and their subsidiaries and controlled entities), to\nexecute agreements and other documents, and to approve and carry out transactions and other\nactions relating to all aspects of the operations of the university, except where powers are\nreserved to the Board of Trustees or other officers, divisions, or subsidiaries of the university by\nresolutions of the Board, the Board’s Bylaws, the Founding Grant, law, or otherwise. The\ndelegation to the President includes, but is not limited to, the power to:\nNegotiate and execute agreements\nExecute other documents, including government and non-government documents\nSubmit applications and reports\nSettle disputes\nAccept gifts, grants and/or other funding\nExercise investment authority other than that which has been expressly delegated to\nStanford Management Company (SMC)\nCreate, maintain, operate and/or dissolve subsidiaries or other related entities of the\nuniversity\nEstablish, maintain and manage bank investment and brokerage accounts and the\nassociated funds\nAdditionally, all financial commitments (as defined below) exceeding $25 million require the\napproval of the Board, unless the commitment is:\nFor ordinary and necessary expenses that are required for the day-to-day operations of the\nuniversity, such as wages, employee benefits, utilities, communication and data charges,\ninsurance premiums, food services and the like\nRequired to comply with tax or other government (domestic and foreign) regulations (e.g.\npayments for taxes, social security, unemployment, disability insurance, etc.)\nProvided under the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) Management and\nOperating (M&O) contract with the Department of Energy\nProvided under investment agreements managed by Stanford Management Company\n(SMC) \nConstruction, renovation or building improvement projects require the approval of the Board,\nunless obtaining an approval may conflict with rights that have been granted under an existing\nagreement, if the project is on or within university-owned land, and:\nHas a financial commitment in excess of $25 million (unless the commitment is otherwise\nprovided under SLAC’s M&O contract or under investment authority otherwise granted to\nSMC),\nIs for creation of new development on a previously undeveloped site, or\nWill result in the change in use of an existing site\n3. Delegation from University President to University\nOfficers, Deans and Directors\nThe President may delegate signature and financial approval authority to each Officer, Dean, and\nDirector reporting to the President (AGM 9.1.1: President and Officers Reporting to the President\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/organization-charts/president-and-officers-reporting-\npresident/organization-chart)) or Provost (AGM 9.2.1: Provost and Officers Reporting to the\nProvost (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/organization-charts/provost-and-officers-\nreporting-provost/organization-chart-provost)).

The dollar limit to this authority, to the extent that it relates to\nfinancial approval authority, is documented in the university’s Authority Manager System\n(http://authority.stanford.edu/). \nFinancial commitments (as defined in the Definitions section) that are reasonably expected to\naccumulate, over the course of the current or ensuing fiscal year(s), to a level in excess of an\nindividual’s delegated signature authority must be treated as being outside of the limits of\ndelegated authority. Such financial commitments must be approved by a delegate with the\nappropriate level of authority, if any, or by the Board of Trustees.\n4. Sub-Delegations\nWithin the scope of authority documented above for each Officer, Dean and Director reporting to\nthe President or Provost, that individual may further sub-delegate signature and/or financial\napproval authority within their line of reporting, unless specifically prohibited. Such sub-\ndelegations must also be documented, retained and available for review in the Signature\nAuthority Delegation Letter Repository (https://fingate.stanford.edu/authority/signature-versus-\nfinancial-approval-authority#anchor-1461) on the Fingate website.\nSignature authority sub-delegations should be limited, to the extent possible, to the next level of\ndirect reports. All additional financial approval authority sub-delegations must be documented\nand maintained in the university Authority Manager system. Sub-delegations must be\ncommensurate with the responsibilities of the sub-delegate. For example, it is generally not\nappropriate to sub-delegate more than half of one’s financial approval authority to another\nindividual. \nSub-delegation of authority does not equate to delegation of responsibility. It remains the\nresponsibility of the person granting the authority to exercise appropriate oversight to ensure that\nsub-delegates exercise their sub-delegation with care and responsibility.\n5. Documentation\nDocumentation of all delegations and sub-delegations is retained and available online for\nreview by anyone with a Stanford University ID (SUNet ID). To learn how to access the repository\nand how to request updates to delegation letters, see Signature Authority Delegation Letter\nRepository (https://fingate.stanford.edu/authority/signature-versus-financial-approval-\nauthority#anchor-1461) on the Fingate website.\n6. Reserved Authority\nRegardless of the scope of an individual’s delegated authority, execution of certain types of\ntransactions and agreements is reserved for specific offices within the university, as further\ndescribed in the applicable policies referenced below. \na. Accepting Gifts on Behalf of the University\nIn general, only Office of Development (OOD) may accept gifts (e.g., cash, property, charitable\ngift trusts or other types of assets) on behalf of the university. In limited circumstances, individual\ndepartments (e.g., libraries and museums) are authorized to accept certain types of gifts (e.g.,\nbooks, archival materials, and arts). OOD should be consulted in the gift solicitation and\nacceptance process as stated in AGM 4.2.1: Receiving and Processing Gifts\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/giving-stanford/receiving-and-processing-\ngifts/receiving-and-processing-gifts).\nb. Construction or Remodeling\nConstruction of new buildings or remodeling involving a major exterior design change is\nmanaged through Lands, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE) (https://lbre.stanford.edu/). Within\npolicy, LBRE may grant approval for Departmentally Managed Projects (DMP), facility and\ninfrastructure projects that are managed by staff within individual schools and departments; see\nthe Departmentally Managed Projects (DMP) policy\n(https://lbre.stanford.edu/pmr/publications/departmentally-managed-projects-dmp-policy).\nc. Employment Policies\nThe Provost, for faculty and academic staff appointments, and the Vice President for University\nHuman Resources, for regular staff and contingent positions, have responsibility for\nestablishment of employment policies.\nd. Investments\nStanford Management Company (SMC) has signature authority for its management of the\nMerged Pool and the Intermediate Pool, and any other investments that it manages or\nadministers. Signature authority related to the School & Department Investment funds is\ndocumented in individual delegation letters for the applicable School/VP Area. SMC reserves the\nauthority to direct other pools of investment capital not managed by SMC as needed to avoid\nconflicts with the Merged Pool and the Intermediate Pool.\ne. Purchasing\nUniversity Procurement, within Financial Management Services, has responsibility for\npurchasing, placing orders and executing contracts for goods and services for the university,\nsubject to the receipt of an approved Purchase Requisition. Procurement is the sole holder of\nthis authority at the university, with the exception of sub-delegations that have been granted by\nthe University President or otherwise approved by the Vice President for Business Affairs & CFO.\nProcurement maintains the list of exceptions as stated in AGM 5.1.1: Procurement Policies\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/purchasing-\npolicies/procurement-policies).\nIndividuals with sufficient financial approval authority may make purchases of commercially\navailable off-the-shelf items and related services of $25,000 or less as long as the purchase\ndoes not require a signed agreement. These purchases must be reasonable and necessary,\nconsistent with established university policies and practices applicable to the work of the\nuniversity, including instruction, research, and public service, and must be consistent with\nsponsor or donor expenditure restrictions.\nIntra-university service agreements, such as requests to university service centers for catering,\nmaintenance or telecommunication services, are outside the purview of University Procurement\nand may be signed and negotiated by the applicable office and academic unit, as long as the\ntransaction is routed to an approver or approvers with a sufficient level of PTA Authority.\nf. Financial Accounts and Debt Issuance\nOpening, maintaining and closing bank accounts is restricted to authorized staff members within\nthe Office of the Treasurer (OoT). Additionally, OoT has responsibility for debt issuance. See\nAGM 3.6.1: Bank Accounts (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-\nadministration/bank-accounts/bank-accounts).\ng. Related Entities\nThe authority to create, acquire, dispose of or terminate legal entities is reserved to the Office of\nGeneral Counsel and the Vice President of Business Affairs & CFO, except as otherwise\nprovided in the applicable policy. See AGM 3.7.1: Establishment and Governance of Legal\nEntities (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/legal-\nentities/establishment-and-governance-legal-entities).\nh. Research-Related Agreements\nThe authority to sign research-related agreements for sponsored grants, contracts, awards, and\nsub-awards is reserved to the Office of Research Administration\n(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/office/office-research-administration) (ORA), the Office of\nTechnology Licensing (http://otl.stanford.edu/) (OTL), the Industrial Contracts Office\n(https://ico.sites.stanford.edu/), and the School of Medicine Research Management Group\n(http://rmg.stanford.edu/) (RMG).\n7. Related Entities and Subsidiaries\nWith respect to the reserved authorities detailed above, if local laws, the subsidiary’s corporate\ngovernance arrangements, or the university’s internal policies require the signature authority or\nfinancial authority to rest with the authorized representative(s) for the subsidiary, the subsidiary\nand the relevant offices should determine the appropriate process to review, manage and sign\nagreements for such reserved authorities.

Financial Commitment\nA financial commitment is defined as all amounts and/or other financial value the university (or\nany of its business units or subsidiaries) will be legally obligated to pay or transfer to a third party\nduring the term of an agreement.\nc. PTA\nAn acronym used for a Project-Task-Award combination representing an account in Stanford’s\nfinancials system.\nd. University Financial Systems\nSystems maintained by the university for the purposes of facilitating and recording financial\ntransactions.\n9. Special Situations\na. Internal Transfer of Expense\nInternal transfer of expense, from one PTA to another, is not subject to this policy as long as the\noriginal approval of the expense was consistent with the policy documented above. However, the\njournal transaction must be routed to an approver or approvers with a sufficient level of PTA\nAuthority. Reference Administrative Guide Memo 3.2.2: Cost Transfers\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/expenditure-\nmanagement/cost-transfers) for details.\nb. Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and Confidential Disclosure\nAgreements (CDAs)\nThe principle of openness in research, as stated in Research Policy Handbook 1.4: Openness in\nResearch (https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/conduct-\nresearch/openness-research), sets forth freedom of access by all interested persons to the\nunderlying data, processes, and final results of research, is of overriding importance at Stanford\nUniversity. Because the university’s “open” environment is not conducive to maintaining\nconfidentiality, generally, the university does not sign NDAs.\nPrincipal Investigators, researchers, or others (collectively “Recipients”) may wish to accept\nconfidential information, materials, or technology from a third-party sponsor or supplier that\nrequires execution of a NDA. Recipients cannot sign on behalf of the university. However,\nRecipients may individually take responsibility for the acceptance and protection of the\ninformation, materials or technology being shared.\nStandard NDA templates are available from Office of Technology Licensing (OTL)\n(https://otl.stanford.edu/industry/sample-agreements-and-forms) and Office of General Counsel\n(OGC) (https://ogc.stanford.edu/).\nIf the sponsor or supplier agrees to use the university’s template without modifications, recipients\nmay sign it with no further review.\nRecipients should be aware that sponsor or supplier requested terms in NDAs may violate\nuniversity policy. Therefore, if the sponsor or supplier presents their own template or requests\nmodifications to the university’s template, Recipients should consult with OSR\n(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/offices), OTL (http://otl.stanford.edu/), the Research\nManagement Group (RMG) (http://rmg.stanford.edu/), the Procurement Services Contracts\nOffice (https://fingate.stanford.edu/directory/activity/11) or OGC prior to signing.\nc. Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) and Letters of Intent (LOIs)\nWhile generally discouraged, in rare circumstances an MOU or LOI may be needed to advance a\nnew relationship in anticipation of future formal agreements. \nSee the Research Policy Handbook (RPH) (https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-\npolicy-handbook/definitions-and-types-agreements/memoranda-understanding-and-letters-intent)\nfor the full policy statement for such agreements, including a link to a standard MOU template.\nd. Click-through Agreements\n“Click-through” agreements are generally used in online transactions, such as purchasing of\nonline services or licensing of software product, where a user is required to agree to terms prior\nto using the product or service. Click-through agreements can be legally binding and therefore\nare subject to this policy. \nIf the click-through agreement creates binding obligations on the University, please review the\nterms before you click “accept” to ensure that the agreement does not contain terms that violate\nuniversity policies. Examples of problematic terms include:\n1. Terms that involve use, license or transfer of the university’s name, logo, trademark,\npatents, copyright, and/or other intellectual property, including for marketing or other\npromotional purposes \n2. Terms that may violate the university’s policies on openness in research\n3. Terms that may commit the university to binding obligations that are beyond the scope of\nthe user’s delegated authority\n4. Terms that may conflict with the university’s privacy and security policies and guidelines.\nFor example, click-through agreements should generally not be used for services involving\nthe storage, receipt, processing or publishing of moderate risk or high risk data (e.g.\nunpublished research data, student records, protected health information, other personally-\nidentifiable information) unless the service providers are reviewed and approved in\naccordance with applicable policies and guidelines.\nPlease consult with Procurement if you require assistance with a click-through agreement that\nmay bind the university. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the university will not be bound\nto any click-through term or condition that conflicts with this policy or other university policies and\nguidelines. Also, please visit Essential Stanford Software (https://uit.stanford.edu/software) or\nSoftware at Stanford (http://web.stanford.edu/dept/its/cgi-bin/services/software/portal/) for\ninformation on software available to use or purchase.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/signature-\nand-financial-approval-authority/signature-and",

    "text": "10.1.1 Undergraduate Student Employment\nAuthority\nThis Guide Memo was approved by the Vice Provost for Student Affairs.\nLast Updated\nOctober 19, 2023\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 24\nThis Guide Memo outlines policies and procedures for employment of Stanford undergraduate\nstudents by the university. For employment of graduate students in research and teaching\nassistantships, see Guide Memo 10.2.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-\nemployment-and-assistantships/graduate-student-employment-campus/graduate-student). For\nemployment of graduate students in hourly positions, see Guide Memo 10.2.2\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-employment-and-assistantships/graduate-\nstudent-employment-campus/graduate-0). \n1. Definitions and Distinctions\na. Student Hourly Employment\nStanford University uses student hourly employment to hire Stanford students for jobs that are\nspecifically earmarked for matriculated students. All Stanford University student employment is\nhourly, with the exception of assistantships, which are limited to graduate students (see Guide\nMemo 10.2.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-employment-and-\nassistantships/graduate-student-employment-campus/graduate-student)). Student workers are\nsupervised and mentored in their work, are hired through the university HR system, and must\nrecord and approve their work hours each pay period. Routine employment procedures, such as\nrecording time and leave, are also a means for preparing student workers for their future\nemployment. Compensation for all undergraduate student jobs must be established on an hourly\nbasis, and the amount of pay is based on the actual number of hours worked in each pay period.\nThese job assignments are incidental to the student’s course of study with reasonable limitations\nplaced during the academic quarter on the nature of the work assignment and the number of\nhours of employment. Students cannot volunteer for positions that are normally paid positions.\nb. Stipend\nConsistent with Stanford’s mission to promote the advancement of public welfare through\neducational cultivation with a hands-on approach, the University supports students engaging in\npaid and unpaid opportunities that further their own intellectual journey and academic training. In\nsome cases, an unpaid opportunity may be supported by a stipend to defray living expenses. \nWhen unpaid work is of an academic nature, the student may receive academic credit with the\nagreement of the mentoring faculty member.\nA stipend is a payment to an enrolled or continuing student meant to support personal scholarly\nactivities such as an undergraduate research project or experiential learning opportunities such\nas an unpaid internship. The payment should be intended to help the student defray research\ncosts, living or travel expenses to enable participation in the scholarly activities or experiential\nlearning opportunities. Stipends are not used to pay for services rendered which primarily benefit\nthe faculty member, Stanford University or its programs or as compensation for employment.\nAll undergraduate stipend payments are processed by the Financial Aid Office\n(http://financialaid.stanford.edu/faculty_staff/undergrad/index.html). Stipends may impact need-\nbased aid and athletic scholarships.\nc. Student Residence Roles\nEach residence on campus has a group of student leaders who facilitate various programmatic\ncomponents of life in the residences. A stipend to defray living expenses is offered in conjunction\nwith many of these roles (https://resed.stanford.edu/get-involved (https://resed.stanford.edu/get-\ninvolved)). Stipends may impact need-based aid and athletic scholarships.\nd. Contingent (Casual or Temporary) Employment\nContingent employment is used to hire an individual for a part-time or temporary staff position.\nContingent employment must be used for hourly employment assignments for non-matriculated\nstudents or matriculated students when on a Leave of Absence. Contingent employment is not\nnormally used for enrolled, matriculated Stanford students but must be used for any student\nworking more than 36 hours per week.\ne. Federal Work-Study (FWS)\nStanford University participates in the FWS program as defined in Title IV of the Higher\nEducation Act. Under this program funds are allocated to Stanford to allow students with\nqualifying financial need to gain valuable work experience while earning money to help pay for\ncollege. The program is administered by the Financial Aid Office in coordination with the hiring\ndepartments. Under the FWS program, federal funds are used to pay 75% of student wages, and\nthe Provost pays the remaining 25%. A subset of the FWS program, Community Service Work-\nStudy, allows qualifying students to work off campus at nonprofits (more information\n(http://financialaid.stanford.edu/faculty_staff/undergrad/index.html)).\nf. Off-Campus Internships and Off-Campus Employment\nOff-Campus internships and employment are not covered by this policy, with the exception of\nfederal Community Service Work-Study positions managed by the Haas Center for Public\nService. In both cases, students are encouraged to be mindful that their primary obligation is to\ntheir academic program.  International students must also adhere to visa requirements.\n2. Listing Student Jobs\na. Job Listing Services\nStanford departments wishing to hire undergraduate students as part-time workers are strongly\nencouraged to use the Handshake system administered by Stanford Career Education to list\ntheir job openings. Programs should log onto https://stanford.joinhandshake.com/login\n(https://stanford.joinhandshake.com/login) to post a job and reach a large cross section of\nstudents. All job postings must include the pay range for the position.\nb. Hours Per Week\nStudents are encouraged to limit their hours of work so that they may devote sufficient attention\nto their studies. Therefore, the jobs listed for undergraduates during any enrollment period\nshould not typically require more than 15 hours per week of work. During break periods between\nquarters, undergraduates may be employed full time. \nThanksgiving Break:\nRestrictions on student work hours do not apply during Thanksgiving recess, beginning the day\nafter classes end (as detailed on the official university academic calendar) and continuing\nthrough the day before classes resume.\nBetween Quarter Breaks:\nRestrictions on student work hours do not apply beginning the day after the University final exam\nperiod ends (as detailed on the official university academic calendar) and continuing through the\nday before classes begin the following quarter.\nFor example: students’ employment hours are not limited between the Saturday after Autumn\nquarter final exams, through the Sunday before Winter classes begin.\nIndividual university holidays, e.g., President’s Day and Memorial Day, do not constitute a break.\nc. International students\nInternational students on F-1 or J-1 visas are subject to both University policies on employment\nand visa requirements that limit employment; in all cases, the more restrictive limitation will apply.\nStudents should consult with Bechtel International Center (https://bechtel.stanford.edu/\n(https://bechtel.stanford.edu/)) if they have questions about work eligibility and limitations on\nwork hours.\nd. Students on Financial Aid\nNearly half of Stanford’s undergraduate population receives need-based aid and most are\nexpected to contribute toward their costs through employment. The standard expectation can be\nmet by working eight to ten hours per week. Not all students receiving aid will qualify for Federal\nWork-Study; when possible, department funded jobs should be made available for students on\naid.\ne. Non-Discrimination\nNon-discrimination policies applicable to regular staff, as stated in Guide Memo 2.1.2\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/recruiting-\nand-hiring-regular-staff), section 2.a, an",

Schedule of Job Categories\nThe following schedule is designed to promote consistency in student pay. Starting wages in\nthese categories are based on the requirements of the job and the applicable experience of the\nstudent. Range within levels is available to allow employers' flexibility in setting student wage\nrates as job requirements and student performance vary widely. The wage scale is updated\nannually at http://financialaid.stanford.edu/aid/employ/wage_scale\n(http://financialaid.stanford.edu/aid/employ/wage_scale.html). All job postings must include the\npay range for the position.\na. Level I\nThe work at this level requires that employees perform tasks characterized by a prescribed\nstandard. Duties typically are repetitive and workers follow simple instructions that require little\ninterpretation or skill. The supervisor determines work priorities and reviews work for accuracy.\nTypical kinds of work at this level include:\nOffice work requiring minimum skills, such as file clerk, messenger, or receptionist\nLight manual labor such as animal caretaker, driver, or tour guide\nRudimentary laboratory work such as glassware washer\nLibrary work such as shelving, checking in materials, completing forms, photocopying, or\npreparing materials for binding\nb. Level II\nAt this level, employees have independent responsibility for the accurate completion of a variety\nof tasks requiring judgment and interpretation in applying procedures correctly. The supervisor\ngenerally reviews the work for correct final results. Typical kinds of work at this level include:\nOffice work requiring basic accounting, or knowledge of office machines\nStrenuous labor such as gardener or storekeeper\nTechnical work requiring specialized skills such as photographer, or projectionist\nLaboratory work requiring a moderate level of scientific knowledge\nLibrary work such as answering information questions, basic use of claims and invoices, or\nnonroutine clerical duties\nc. Level III\nAt this level, employees have substantial responsibility for determining work procedures and\nmethods of work and for coordinating phases of work with others. Originality, analysis, and\njudgment are required to carry out work. The supervisor reviews work when guidance is required.\nTypical kinds of work include:\nComputer programmer\nAdministrative assistant\nMusician, or artist\nJob recruiter\nLibrary work that requires extensive use of foreign languages, having responsibility for a\nbranch library or similar unit for long periods of time without supervision, or very specialized\nbibliographic searching including in-depth use of RLIN\n4. Hiring, Paying, and Supervising Students\na. Hiring\nThe supervisor notifies the human resources administrator to make the appropriate system entry.\nStudents should be hired into the appropriate Job Classification Code (JCC)\n(https://financialaid.stanford.edu/faculty_staff/undergrad/wage_scale.html). The student must be\nhired into the university HR system before beginning work. Students who are hired during\nsummer quarter, but who are not enrolled, must be hired as Student Hourly Employees using the\nappropriate Summer Student JCC. This step is required even if the student is continuing a work\nassignment that started during the academic year.  Procedures for hiring FWS students can be\nfound at http://financialaid.stanford.edu/faculty_staff/undergraduate\n(http://financialaid.stanford.edu/faculty_staff/undergrad/index.html).\nStudents who receive a university award that includes funding to hire undergraduate students to\ncomplete hourly work (e.g., coding, transcription, or other effort associated with academic\nprojects) are subject to these policies. In such cases, the department should manage the funding\nand hire the student hourly employee.\nb. Remote Work\nSome departments may have work conducive to hiring student hourly employees who perform\nsome, or all, of their work at a remote site. When considering whether a remote work\narrangement is appropriate, managers should take into consideration, among other factors, the\nnature of the work, the costs, and whether the work should or must be performed remotely.\nDecisions about the suitability of remote work arrangements are discretionary and require\napproval from the Dean or Associate Dean, Vice or Associate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate\nVice President or designee as well as the local senior HR Manager.  Remote work performed\noutside of California is subject to Guide Memo 2.2.2 Out-of-State Employees\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-policies/out-\nstate-employees).\nc. Payment\nDepartments pay student workers from their own sources of funding, except for students who\nqualify for FWS. Hourly student workers must record actual hours worked in Axess Timecard\neach pay period. Each month has two pay periods: The first day of the month through the 15th\nand the 16th through the last day of the month. Paychecks are issued on the workday that falls\non or immediately prior to the seventh calendar day after the end of each pay period.\nd. Supervision\nOne person should be named as the student's immediate supervisor and should be directly\naccountable for overseeing the student's work and ensuring view and approval of hours worked\nin Axess.\ne. Work Schedules\nA student is expected to work the agreed hours, be punctual and satisfy all reasonable\nrequirements of the employer with regard to performance and behavior. Most on-campus\nemployers build in some flexibility in hours given students' exam schedules, but that is not\nalways possible and students are expected to carry through if they have agreed to be at work.\nf. Sick Time\nSick time provides a mechanism to pay student hourly employees when they are unable to\nperform their work responsibilities due to illness or for other related reasons. All Stanford student\nhourly employees receive sick time benefits. Arrangements for any variations in work hours,\nincluding time off for illness or related uses of sick time, should be made individually with the\nstudent hourly employee’s supervisor. To the extent possible, student hourly employees are\nencouraged to make arrangements outside of their working hours and supervisors are\nencouraged to offer flexibility in work hours. For information about the accrual and use of sick\ntime for student hourly employees, see Administrative Guide Memo 10.3.1\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-employment-and-assistantships/sick-time-\nstudent-hourly-employees/sick-time-student).\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-employment-and-\nassistantships/undergraduate-student-employment-campus-0",

    "text": "10.2.1 Graduate Student Assistantships\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice Provost for Graduate Education.\nLast Updated\nJuly 11, 2025\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 24.2\nThis Guide Memo summarizes the regulations regarding graduate student assistantship\nappointments at Stanford University. Definition of the graduate student assistantship is followed\nby the criteria for eligibility to hold an assistantship, a brief description of each type of\nassistantship, the rules governing tuition allowance, and other policy matters. For questions,\nplease contact the relevant school dean’s office or the Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate\nEducation. \nFor policies that apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, refer to the\nagreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/workplace-essentials/policies/labor-relations-collective-\nbargaining) for details.\nApplicability: Applies to the appointment of graduate students to graduate student\nassistantships.\n1. Definitions and Distinctions\na. Graduate Student Assistantships\nGraduate student assistantships are a form of student employment, earning a compensation\npackage including both salary and tuition allowance (TAL) for the performance of research or\nteaching services to Stanford as part of the student's academic and professional training and\ndevelopment. For the purposes of this policy “home department” refers to the academic program\nor department in which the student is enrolled; “hiring department” refers to the administrative\nunit in which the student holds the assistantship.\nDistinctions from Assistantships:\nFellowships\nFellowship stipends are financial aid, not salary. No service is expected in return for a fellowship;\nit is awarded on a merit basis to assist a student in the pursuit of a degree.\nHourly Employment through Payroll\nGraduate students may be employed and paid for research and teaching work unrelated to the\nstudent's academic and professional training as described in Administrative Guide 10.2.2\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-employment-and-assistantships/graduate-\nstudent-employment-campus/graduate-0): Graduate Student Hourly Employment. Such\nemployment is not considered an assistantship appointment, does not generate tuition, and is\nnot processed in GFS.\nb. The Graduate Financial Support (GFS) system\nGFS is the online application used to enter all graduate student research and teaching\nassistantship appointments and fellowships. Although they are not matriculated Stanford\ngraduate students, postdoctoral scholars' appointments also are entered in GFS. GFS also\nhandles financial support for other non-matriculated graduate students, e.g., visiting student\nresearchers. Non-matriculated students are, however, in general not eligible for assistantships.\nc. Open Assistantship\nAn assistantship is considered “open” when it is not committed to or allocated for a specific\nstudent or limited group of students, such as a PhD advisor’s own students or a group of\nstudents within a specific discipline. Most assistantships are not considered to be “open”. \nOpen assistantships are posted to (advertised on) a dedicated university website identified for\nthis purpose. Posting on the identified university website does not preclude the use of other\nadvertising and recruiting platforms.\n2. Assistantship Eligibility Criteria\na. Matriculation at Stanford\nA graduate student must be matriculated, be in an active graduate degree program, and be\neligible to enroll in coursework. Coterminal students in both an undergraduate and graduate\ndegree program are eligible for assistantships once they are in the Graduate Tuition Group\n(https://bulletin.stanford.edu/academic-polices/tuition-fees/coterminal-tuition). Students of New\nFaculty (SNF) are eligible for research assistantships only.\nb. Enrollment\nStudents must be enrolled in each quarter in which an assistantship is held. For autumn, winter\nand spring quarters, the student must be enrolled in at least 8 units to be appointed to an\nassistantship. For summer quarter, the enrollment requirement is reduced to 1 unit. \nExceptions to this enrollment requirement may include students under at least one of the\nfollowing:\non TGR status,\nwith an approved Graduate Petition for Part-time Enrollment,\nenrolled for an approved Graduation Quarter,\non Honors Cooperative Program (HCP) student status, or\nin an approved childbirth accommodation period.\nc. Relevancy\nTeaching or research service performed must be related to the student's academic and\nprofessional development in order to qualify for an assistantship appointment.\nNote: Entering and approving the assistantship appointment in Graduate Financial Support\n(GFS)/Worklist Manager constitutes a statement that the work involved is relevant to the\nstudent's academic program.\nd. English proficiency for teaching assistantships\nAll international students are required to submit TOEFL scores as part of their Stanford graduate\nprogram application must be approved for English proficiency before being appointed to any\nteaching position. Students need only pass the TA screening prior to their first teaching\nassistantship; it does not need to be repeated for subsequent teaching positions.\nThe department that plans to appoint an international student as a TA/CA must have the\nstudent review the TA screening webpage (https://language.stanford.edu/esol-ta-screening-\nand-waiver), that has information about making an appointment.  \nWhenever possible, TA screening should occur at least one full quarter in advance of the\nassistantship appointment to allow time for the student  to take any required or\nrecommended classes to improved communication skills.\nUpon successful completion of the TA screen and/or required classes, ESOL enters the\napproval of English proficiency (TA OK) in the GFS system, after which the assistantship\nappointment can be processed.\ne. I-9 eligibility to work in the U.S.A.\nBy federal regulation, all individuals receiving salary through Payroll must demonstrate eligibility\nto work in the U.S.A. by filing Federal Form I-9. Departments must forward necessary paperwork\nto Payroll in advance of the student's first paycheck. For more information, see Student Specific\nPayroll Administration\n(http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payadmin/payadmin_student.html). \nf. Social Security Number\nA Social Security number (SSN) is required of all Stanford employees and must be on file with\nPayroll.\ng. Alternatives\nIn the case where no matriculated graduate student is available to fill a need for a research or\nteaching assistantship, an undergraduate or non-matriculated person may be hired in the\ncategories of teaching aide or research aide. These are hourly-paid positions, processed through\nthe Human Resources Management System (HRMS), not the GFS system. Individuals appointed\nto these positions are never eligible for a tuition allowance. The appropriate department chair,\nprogram director, and school dean's office should confirm that no matriculated graduate student\nis available before these alternative appointments are processed.\n3. Types of Assistantship Appointments: Teaching\nGraduate student teaching assistantship responsibilities are categorized into the following four\nappointment levels.\nNote: Students may not be appointed to an assistantship for a course in which they are\nsimultaneously enrolled as a student.\na. Course Assistant (CA)\nCourse assistants support faculty member(s) who have primary responsibility for a course.\nDuties vary but do not include classroom teaching.\n Responsibilities may include:\nassisting in the preparation of lecture materials and running laboratory sessions;\nattending class meetings or lab sessions;\nconducting review sessions;\ncoordinating other aspects of the course (e.g., speakers, activities, etc.);\nholding office hours;\nmonitoring or maintaining existing course websites;\nresponding to student questions;\nmarking and/or grading some por",

    "text": "her aspects of the course (e.g., speakers, activities, etc.);\nholding office hours;\nmonitoring or maintaining existing course websites;\nresponding to student questions;\nmarking and/or grading some portion or all of the exams or papers (but not independently\nassigning the final grade).\nb. Teaching Assistant (TA)\nTeaching assistants have significantly more independence than a course assistant and support\nfaculty member(s) who have primary responsibility for a course.\nIn addition to the responsibilities held by a course assistant, TA responsibilities may include:\npreparing for class sections and/or laboratories where new material may be presented;\npresenting material in a classroom or lab setting.\nc. Graduate Teaching Affiliate (TF)\nThis teaching appointment is limited to graduate students who have had substantial teaching\nexperience. The graduate teaching affiliate will typically be identified as an instructor or co-\ninstructor of the course in Stanford publications and will have primary charge and responsibility\nfor the course (with the mentorship of a faculty member). In some cases, graduate teaching\naffiliates have full responsibility for a course where the content is defined by a faculty coordinator.\nResponsibilities may include:\npreparing, teaching, grading and assessing student work, conducting regular office hours,\netc., in keeping with the established practices of the offering department or program;\ndeveloping course materials independently with the guidance of a faculty mentor for a\ncourse approved by the offering department/program in which it is offered;\nsupervising CAs and TAs assigned to the course.\nd. Mentor Teaching Assistant (MTA)\nThis teaching appointment is limited to graduate students with substantial teaching experience.\nIn addition to the responsibilities of a course or teaching assistant, responsibilities may include:\nserving as a head teaching assistant to coordinate the training and guidance of teaching\nassistants in a given course or set of courses;\ndeveloping complex materials in support of a course or group of courses.\n4. Types of Assistantship Appointments: Research\na. Research Assistant\nResearch assistants conduct research under the direction of a faculty member or other\ndesignated supervisor.\n5. Percentage and Period of Assistantship Appointments\na. Full-quarter Appointments\nAssistantship appointments are made for a full quarter of three months. Standard appointment\nperiods are:\nautumn quarter: October 1–December 31,\nwinter quarter: January 1–March 31,\nspring quarter: April 1–June 30, and\nsummer quarter: July 1–September 30.\nNote that these dates are different from the start and stop dates of quarters on the university’s\nacademic calendar. This timing delivers continuous salary to students on assistantship appointed\nfor multiple sequential quarters, i.e., students on assistantship are paid during the periods\nbetween quarters.\nWork before the start of the appointment period and after the end of the appointment period is\nalso included in the total workload for the quarter.\nb. Autumn, Winter and Spring Assistantship Appointments\n(1) Percentage of Time\nDuring autumn, winter, and spring quarters:\nIncrements: The percentage of appointments must be in increments of 5% time.\n10% Minimum: the minimum assistantship is 10% time.\n50% Maximum: The typical maximum assistantship appointment is 50% time, allowing\nstudents on assistantship to make expeditious progress toward their degree. Assistantships\ntotaling more than 50% are generally prohibited as they may impede academic progress.\nAn appointment of 40% may be combined with a 10% appointment to total 50%. Appointments of\n45% are not allowed.\n(2) Approval for Exceptions\nAssistantships for more than 50% time during the academic year, two concurrent assistantships\ntotaling more than 50% time, or enrollment in more than 10 units while holding a 50%\nappointment, require the prior approval of the student's advisor, the Department Chair, and\nSchool Dean's office.\nRecommendations for such assistantship appointments should indicate the academic\nprogress of the student and the anticipated degree completion date; the student must have\nbeen admitted to candidacy.\nApproval will be granted only where such an assistantship appointment will not interfere\nwith progress towards the degree and normally will be granted for no more than one year.\nc. Summer Assistantship Appointments\n(1) Percentage of Time\nIn summer quarter, students on assistantship may hold an assistantship up to 90% FTE (36\nhours of work per week). 55% assistantships are not allowed. Students on assistantship must be\nenrolled for at least one unit in order to hold a summer quarter assistantship.\n(2)  Enrollment\nIn summer quarter, graduate students must be enrolled in at least one unit or approved for an\nexception outlined in section 2.b. Students in assistantships totaling more than 50% will have\ntheir tuition allowance reduced proportionately (see Salary & TAL Tables\n(http://gfs.stanford.edu/tables (http://gfs.stanford.edu/tables)) in order to accommodate additional\nhours of employment. Students combining an assistantship with more than 8 hours of hourly\nemployment during the summer should reduce their enrollment in proportion to their total\nsummer quarter employment.\nFor additional information regarding tuition allowance in summer quarter, see Section 7.d(4).\nd. Assistantships Totaling More Than 50%\nThe maximum assistantship, as an individual appointment or through combined assistantships,\nin any quarter is 90%. Appointments totaling more than 36 hours per week may not be processed\nin GFS, are not considered assistantships, and do not include a tuition allowance; they should\ninstead be hired through HR.\nWhenever possible, graduate student assistantships totaling more than 50% should be\nestablished as a single appointment, rather than a combination of smaller appointments. (This\nallows GFS to calculate the appropriate TAL; if entered separately, administrators must\ndetermine the appropriate TAL cost and split, and coordinate adjustments to GFS.)\ne. Shortened Summer Assistantships\nDuring summer quarter, many courses are shorter and the between-quarters period is longer\nthan in autumn/winter/spring quarters. A teaching or research assistantship may be offered for\nless than the full three-month period but must be at least two months in duration.\nSummer quarter assistantships must begin on the quarterly start-date (July 1), and the end date\nmay be set at two months or later (Aug 31), rather than the full 3-month period (Sept 30). In\nthese cases, the student in assistantship will earn the full tuition allowance and a specific salary\nper pay period (often, the department's standard semi-monthly salary). The student should be\nadvised that the shorter work period will generate less total salary.\n6. Salary\nMinimum assistantship salaries (https://gfs.stanford.edu/tables) are outlined on the Graduate\nFinancial Support website (http://gfs.stanford.edu/tables). For assistantships covered by a\ncollective bargaining agreement refer to the applicable agreement at Labor Relations &\nCollective Bargaining (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/workplace-essentials/policies/labor-\nrelations-collective-bargaining). Degree programs may pay a student in assistantship more, but\nnot less, than these minimums.\nSource of Funding\na. Salary for Teaching Assistantships\nTeaching assistantships may be paid by a university budget allocation to the\nschools/departments or by school/departmental funds.\nb. Salary for Research Assistantships\nResearch assistantships may be paid by an external/sponsored source of funds or school/\ndepartmental funds.\n7. Tuition Allowance (TAL)\na. Definition\nTuition allowance (TAL) is a component of an assistantship compensation package and\nrepresents a commitment to support a student's educational program through the payment of a\nportion of the student's tuition bill.\nb.

    "text": "sents a commitment to support a student's educational program through the payment of a\nportion of the student's tuition bill.\nb. Source of Funding\nThe value of TAL for a 50% assistantship appointment is established as the tuition value for 8-10\nunits (8-9 units in the Law School, and 8 units in the MED MD program). The value of tuition\nallowance for assistantship appointments of between 10% and 50% is a proportional amount\ndefined by TAL Tables (http://gfs.stanford.edu/tables) (http://gfs.stanford.edu/tables) published\neach year.\nTuition charges and TAL are based on the student's home school tuition rate, regardless of the\nlocation of the assistantship. The hiring school/department is responsible for funding tuition\nallowance based on the student's home school/department tuition rate.\nStanford requires that any outside tuition support to which students have access will be used to\nthe full extent before TAL is claimed. Acceptance of a Stanford assistantship obliges a student to\ninform the department of additional aid received.\n(1) Tuition Allowance (TAL) Funding for Research Assistantships\nTuition allowance (TAL) for research assistants is subsidized by the University or the school in\nwhich the research assistant is working and funded as follows:\nFor sponsored awards that pay the full Facilities and Administrative (F&A) rate\n(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/topics/rates), Stanford contributes 55% to the tuition\nallowance amount.\nFor all other funding sources, Stanford contributes 40% of the tuition allowance amount.\nTGR/Medical School Research Rate (MSRR) tuition is paid in full by the student’s\nassociated assistantship. Students in TGR, graduation quarter, or MSRR tuition do not\nreceive university or school tuition allowance.\nThe School of Medicine contributes 19% of the tuition allowance amount for research\nassistants funded by the school.\nIn the School of Business and School of Medicine, university general funds are used to pay\nthe Stanford portion of tuition allowance for research assistants. The Schools of Business\nand Medicine contribute tuition allowance for research assistants from school funds.\n(2) Tuition Allowance (TAL) Funding for Teaching Assistantships\nIn all schools except otherwise listed below, TAL for teaching assistants is funded by a\nuniversity budget allocation to the schools/departments. Schools, departments or programs\nmay also fund additional TAL for teaching assistants, beyond the university budget\nallocation.\nIn the School of Business and School of Medicine, the respective schools are responsible\nfor contributing tuition allowance for teaching assistants working in these schools.\n(3) Federal Work Study (FWS)\n Federal Work Study (FWS) funds cannot be used to pay TAL.\nFor students with research assistantships funded by FWS, FWS funds pay the\nassistantship salary and the school or department contributes the \"sponsored portion”.\nTeaching assistantships funded by federal work study fund the assistantship salary. Tuition\nallowance funding for these students on assistantship is as described in Section 7. (2)\nabove.\n(4) Tuition Allowance Funding for Military Personnel\nStanford faculty may use research project funding to pay the tuition for graduate students on\nmilitary scholarships where the provision of their military support includes a prohibition of salary\npayment from Stanford in certain limited circumstances:\n The student has a statement of financial support from their branch of the US military,\ndefining the terms of the student's support while enrolled at Stanford. The agreement must\nstate that the student can receive tuition support from Stanford but may not be paid a\nsalary by Stanford. If this arrangement continues for more than one year, the student\nshould present evidence that the military scholarship is continuing for each year.\nThe student will average at least 20 hours of work per week on the project for each quarter\nin which they are paid, earning TAL for a 50% assistantship. This arrangement should also\nbe documented by means of an assistantship agreement.\nAll records to document this arrangement are kept with the student's records.\nIn the case where the graduate student is working on a faculty member's research project and\nmeets all eligibility requirements, the graduate student may be appointed as a research\nassistant. The salary line may then be cancelled, leaving the remaining tuition allowance\npayment in compensation for the work performed.\n(5) Students Working in Schools Other Than Where They Are Enrolled\nWhen teaching or research assistants are appointed in a school other than the one in which they\nare enrolled, the school in which the student is under assistantship (hiring school/department) is\nresponsible for paying the TAL at the student's home school tuition rate. In the case of research\nassistants, splitting tuition between the sponsored source and Stanford (either 60%/40% or\n81%/19%) is controlled by the school paying the student in assistantship.\n(6) Terminal Graduate Registration (TGR), Terminal Medical Registration (TMR) and\nMedical School Research Rate (MSRR)\nTAL cannot be carried forward to pay TGR/TMR/MSRR tuition in future quarters.\nTGR/TMR/MSRR tuition is paid in full by the associated assistantship (see below). The\nGFS system will not divide TGR/TMR/MSRR tuition and share the cost with university or\nschool funds.\nFor research assistants, TGR/TMR/MSRR tuition is charged directly to the source of funds\npaying the student's salary.\nFor teaching assistants, TGR/TMR/MSRR tuition is paid in the same manner as other TAL\nfunding for teaching assistants (see section 2, above).\nd. Amount of Tuition Allowance\n(1) Percent Time\nThe amount of TAL earned depends on the percentage of time of the graduate student\nassistantship. See the Tuition Allowance Tables (http://gfs.stanford.edu/tables)\n(http://gfs.stanford.edu/tables).\nThe minimum assistantship appointment is 10% and provides TAL equal to the value of two\nunits of tuition. (Note: The minimum tuition charged by Stanford during the autumn, winter,\nand spring quarters is three units, and therefore a 10% assistantship will not provide\nenough tuition allowance to cover Stanford's minimum unit-based tuition.)\nThe maximum assistantship appointment during autumn, winter and spring quarters is\n50%, and provides TAL equal to 8-10 units of tuition charge, except in the Law School\nwhich earns the 8-9 unit value and in the MED MD program, where it earns the 8 unit\nvalue.\nFor assistantship appointments of 50-90%, the total TAL earned decreases as the\npercentage of time increases. (For example: A student's 70% assistantship(s) earns the\nsame TAL as a 30% appointment.) For the rules governing appointments greater than 50%,\nsee section 5.b.4 (required pre-approval for exceptions, autumn, winter and spring), 5.c\n(summer), and 5.d. See also tuition allowance tables for summer quarter.\n(2) Length of Assistantships\nAppointments are made for a full three month period (see \"Percentage and Period of\nAppointment,\" Section 5 of this document). Appointments will earn the designated amount of TAL\nfor the full quarter in which the student is appointed.\n(3) Multiple Assistantships\nStudents may hold multiple assistantship appointments, including both research assistantships\nand teaching assistantships, simultaneously. At most, the 8-10 units of TAL value may be earned\nwhen combining multiple assistantships.\nMultiple assistantships totaling 50% or less: GFS automatically calculates the total\ncombined percentage of the assistantships that will be the basis for the amount of TAL. For\nexample, two 25% assistantship appointments earn a combined TAL equal to a 50%\nappointment: 8-10 units. (During the academic year, combined appointments should not\ntotal more than 50%; see 5.b, above).\nMultiple assistantships totaling more than 50% (e.g. in summer quarter): If entered as\none appointment with multiple sources of funding, GFS correctly calculates the combined\nTAL as described in 5.d.

If entered as separate appointments, GFS cannot do the\ncalculation: administrators must determine both the reduced total TAL and the proportional\ncost to each appointment, then adjust each appointment's TAL in GFS.\n(4) Summer Appointments\n In summer quarter, some students may enroll in fewer units than the TAL earned by their\nassistantship appointment(s). In such cases, the TAL for their summer quarter\nassistantships is reduced by adjusting the TAL amount in GFS to match the actual tuition\namount billed.\nSummer quarter appointments are for either a two month or three month period; the\ncourses may be scheduled for 8 or 10 weeks.\ne. Use of Tuition Allowance\n1. Tuition allowance can be used only in the quarter in which it was generated by an\nappointment.\n2. Tuition allowance may be used only as a credit against tuition charges. It is:\nNot convertible to cash;\nNot transferable to another student;\nNot usable for any other charges, such as ASSU fees; and\nNot applicable to tuition charges for Continuing Studies Program courses.\n8. Work in Addition to Assistantship Appointment\nTo preserve the focus on the student's academic progress, Stanford formally limits the number of\nhours a student may be employed while also holding an assistantship appointment. Graduate\nstudents are expected to coordinate additional hourly employment with the assistantship\nappointment, and with their academic obligations, including course load, number of registered\nunits, and the academic expectations of their program. Academic departments/programs, offices\nemploying students, and funding sources may also impose employment limitations. Graduate\nstudent hourly employment is described in Administrative Guide Memo 10.2.2\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-employment-and-assistantships/graduate-\nstudent-employment-campus/graduate-0) (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-\nemployment-and-assistantships/graduate-student-employment-campus/graduate-0): Graduate\nStudent Hourly Employment.\nDuring break periods when classes are officially not in session, including between-quarter break\nperiods and Thanksgiving break, Stanford does not limit the number of hours graduate students\nmay be employed. Additional information about break periods is located in Administrative Guide\n10.2.2 Graduate Student Hourly Employment (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-\nemployment-and-assistantships/graduate-student-employment-campus/graduate-0)\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-employment-and-assistantships/graduate-\nstudent-employment-campus/graduate-0).\na. Limit on Hours for U.S. Students\nDuring autumn, winter and spring quarters, students on 50% assistantships may not be\nemployed more than an additional eight hours a week inside Stanford and/or outside of Stanford;\nthose eight hours cannot be in other assistantship positions. During summer quarter, enrolled\ngraduate students are limited to 36 hours of employment weekly, combining hourly employment\nand assistantship.\nb. Limit on Hours for International students\nInternational students on F-1 or J-1 visas are subject to both university policies on employment\nand visa requirements that limit employment; in all cases, the more restrictive limitation will apply.\nInternational students are eligible for on-campus employment if they are maintaining their F-1 or\nJ-1 status. During the academic year (autumn, winter and spring quarters), students on F-1 or J-\n1 visas are limited to a total of 20 hours of employment per week (except the break periods\nbetween quarters), including both hourly jobs and assistantship appointments), and including any\noff-campus employment that they may have been authorized to perform.\nFor further information regarding regulations for students with F-1 and J-1 visas, contact Bechtel\nInternational Center (https://bechtel.stanford.edu) (https://bechtel.stanford.edu/).\n9. Cancellation, Termination, or Modification of\nAssistantship Appointments\nFor assistantships covered by the collective bargaining agreement, refer to the applicable\nagreement at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/workplace-essentials/policies/labor-relations-collective-\nbargaining). The policies below apply to assistantships for non-bargaining unit members only.\na. Cancellation before the Start Date of the Assistantship\nFor all other assistantships, if an appointment is cancelled on or before the start date of the\nassistantship:\n1. no salary is paid;\n2. no tuition allowance is provided;\n3. if tuition allowance has been applied to the student's bill, it will be withdrawn;\n4. the student is responsible for any tuition charges for the quarter.\nb. Cancellation after the start date of the assistantship\nIf the school or department terminates the assistantship for any reason during the quarter, other\nthan for cause, salary will end but the student will receive the full quarter TAL. This includes\ncircumstances where sponsored funding for an assistantship ends.\nc. Termination of Appointment\nIf a graduate student voluntarily terminates an assistantship or is removed for just cause, salary\nends, and TAL is withdrawn for the quarter.\nSalary ends and TAL will be applied as needed to pay the student's bill for the quarter when an\nassistantship appointment is terminated because a student has:\n1. completed all of the degree requirements and leaves the University; or,\n2. formally withdrawn from a degree program and leaves the University; or,\n3. taken an approved Leave of Absence from the University (for emergency/medical needs).\n10. Taxes and Tax Reporting\na. Salaries and Tuition Allowance\nAll salaries from assistantships are subject to federal and state income tax and tax\nwithholding.\nTuition allowance associated with assistantships for degree-seeking students is not subject\nto tax.\nb. Exemption from FICA and VDI Taxes\nEnrollment and regular attendance in courses or fulfillment of other requirements associated with\na degree program are required for all students in each quarter of their appointment(s), including\nsummer, in order to qualify for exemption from FICA (Social Security) and VDI (Voluntary\nDisability Insurance) taxes.\n11. Benefits\nThe graduate appointments described in this Guide Memo are designed for and available only to\nStanford students.\na. Time Off\nAssistantship appointments do not accrue vacation leave.\nStudents with research or teaching assistantships receive a lump sum of 40 hours of paid sick\ntime per calendar year, which is available for use during any appointment period during the year.\nSick time does not carry over from one calendar year to the next.\nArrangements for any variations in work hours, including time off for vacation, jury duty, illness, or\nrelated use of sick time should be made individually with the faculty supervisor. Requests for\npersonal time off will be evaluated based on obligations attendant to a student’s work\nresponsibilities, duration, and supervisor approval, and will not be unreasonably denied. To the\nextent possible, students are encouraged to make arrangements outside of their working hours\nand faculty supervisors are encouraged to offer flexibility in work hours.\nRegular semi-monthly salary is paid during periods when sick time is used. When sick time is\nused, the student notifies Payroll via Help Ticket (https://stanford.service-\nnow.com/finance_payroll_services?\nid=sc_cat_item&sys_id=75209554135a4b008a9175c36144b0c9) (https://stanford.service-\nnow.com/finance_payroll_services?\nid=sc_cat_item&sys_id=75209554135a4b008a9175c36144b0c9).

Health Insurance\nEligibility for health insurance benefit is determined quarterly on the basis of assistantship and\nfellowship appointments approved as of the payroll deadline of each quarter. Students on\nassistantship are eligible for a health insurance subsidy as long as they do not waive Cardinal\nCare insurance or have their insurance paid fully by an outside source of funds.\nThe health insurance subsidy is as follows for eligible students on assistantship:\nStudents on assistantship appointments for 25% time or more per quarter will receive a\nsubsidy paying 100% of the cost of the single-student Cardinal Care premium.\nStudents on assistantship appointments of less than 25% time per quarter will receive a\nsubsidy paying 50% of the cost of the single-student Cardinal Care premium.\n12. Resources for Additional Information\nAll graduate student assistantships must be entered online using the Graduate Financial\nSupport (GFS) system in PeopleSoft.\nFor policy questions, refer to the GFS Policy Website\n(https://gfs.stanford.edu/resources.html) (https://gfs.stanford.edu/resources.html).\nFor entry questions, contact the IT Help Desk at 5-4357 (5-HELP), or\nhttp://helpsu.stanford.edu (http://helpsu.stanford.edu) (http://helpsu.stanford.edu/).\nFor graduate student health insurance, contact Vaden Health Center\n(http://vaden.stanford.edu) (http://vaden.stanford.edu/).\nSalary rates and tuition allowance tables: The minimum salary rates for TAs, RAs, and the\nTAL Tables can be found at http://gfs.stanford.edu/tables (http://gfs.stanford.edu/tables)\n(http://gfs.stanford.edu/tables).\n \nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-employment-and-\nassistantships/graduate-student-employment-campus/graduate-student",

    "text": "10.2.2 Graduate Student Hourly Employment\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice Provost for Graduate Education.\nLast Updated\nAugust 25, 2025\nThis Guide Memo outlines policies and procedures for employment of matriculated Stanford\ngraduate students in positions other than assistantships. For employment of graduate students in\nresearch and teaching assistantships, see Guide Memo 10.2.1\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-employment-and-assistantships/graduate-\nstudent-employment-campus/graduate-student). For employment of matriculated undergraduate\nstudents, see Guide Memo 10.1.1. (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-\nemployment-and-assistantships/undergraduate-student-employment-campus-0)\nApplicability:\nApplies to the employment of matriculated graduate students in positions other than\nassistantships. This policy does not apply to non-matriculated graduate students (e.g., Visiting\nStudent Researchers) nor to matriculated students who are not enrolled at the time of\nemployment.\nFor policies that apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, refer to the\nagreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/workplace-essentials/policies/labor-relations-collective-\nbargaining) for details.\n1. Definitions and Distinctions\n1. This policy applies to students who are enrolled in a Stanford graduate degree program\n(any degree except the BA, BS, or BAS). For purposes of student employment, students\nenrolled in both undergraduate and graduate degree programs as coterminal students are\nconsidered undergraduate students while assessed undergraduate tuition and graduate\nstudents while assessed graduate tuition.\n2. Stanford University uses graduate student hourly employment to hire Stanford graduate\nstudents into jobs that are specifically earmarked for matriculated students. Graduate\nstudents in hourly employment are supervised in their work, hired through the PeopleSoft\nHR system, and must record and obtain approval for their work hours. Compensation is\nestablished on an hourly basis, and the amount of pay is based on the actual number of\nhours worked in each pay period.\n3. Hourly positions are typically reserved for assignments that are incidental to the student’s\ncourse of study with reasonable limitations placed during the academic quarter on the\nnature of the work assignment and the number of hours of employment. All Stanford\nUniversity student employment is hourly, with the exception of assistantships, which are\nlimited to graduate students (see Admin Guide 10.2.1).\n4. Job Classification Codes (JCC)\n(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yGLF4PscBVmAAPoTF0uQpr3kgPcbrjhzap_iBV05-\njc/edit?usp=sharing) are used to categorize all jobs at Stanford. Enrolled students should\nbe hired into the appropriate graduate student JCC\n(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yGLF4PscBVmAAPoTF0uQpr3kgPcbrjhzap_iBV05-\njc/edit?usp=sharing). Hourly employment should never be used to pay a graduate student\nfor work that is appropriately treated as an assistantship (see also section 2. Limits on\nHours of Employment).\n5. The Graduate Financial Support (GFS) system is the online application used to enter all\nresearch and teaching assistantship appointments, fellowships, and other stipend\npayments for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. It is not used to process hourly\nemployment.\na. Distinctions from Hourly Employment\nGraduate student assistantships. Graduate student assistantships are a form of student\nemployment, earning a compensation package including both salary and tuition allowance (TAL)\nfor the performance of research or teaching services to Stanford as part of the student's\nacademic and professional training and development, see Administrative Guide 10.2.1. Hourly\nemployment is not a substitute for an assistantship appointment.\nHonorarium. An honorarium is a stipend payment to recognize a student for an accomplishment\nor a one-time event or project, such as a recruitment weekend. Honoraria are not used as\ncompensation for employment. Graduate student honorarium payments are processed as\nstipends in the Graduate Financial Support system (GFS).\nStudent Residence Roles. Student residence roles are held by a core group of students that\nare responsible for managing the various programmatic components of life in their on campus\nresidence. A nominal stipend to defray living expenses is offered in conjunction with many of\nthese roles. These payments are processed as stipends in GFS. International students should\nconsult with Bechtel International Center about the impact of this effort on restrictions related to\non-campus employment.\nOff-Campus Internships and Off-Campus Employment. Off-campus internships and off-\ncampus employment are not covered by this policy. Students should be mindful that their primary\nobligation is to their academic program. International students must also adhere to visa\nrequirements and should consult with Bechtel International Center before engaging in any off-\ncampus employment or unpaid opportunity.\nContingent (Casual or Temporary) Employment. Contingent employment is used to hire an\nindividual for a part-time or temporary staff position. Contingent employment must be used for\nhourly employment assignments for non-matriculated students, such as Visiting Student\nResearchers, and for matriculated students when not enrolled (e.g. when on a leave of absence).\nContingent employment is not normally used for enrolled, matriculated Stanford students.\n2. Limits on Hours of Employment\nGraduate students are expected to devote sufficient attention to their studies. Therefore,\ngraduate students are expected to coordinate the number of hours of employment with their\nacademic obligations, including course load, number of registered units, and the academic\nexpectations of their program. Additionally, students in hourly employment are expected to\ncoordinate hourly employment with the other forms of financial support that they are receiving.\nAcademic departments/programs, offices employing graduate students, and funding sources\nmay impose additional employment limitations.\nLimits on hourly employment and related enrollment limitations for graduate students are\nsummarized in Table 1.\na. Limit on Hours\nThere are formal limits on the number of hours a graduate student may be employed when also\nfinancially supported by assistantships or fellowships. The source of the fellowship or the\nstudent’s academic department/program may impose additional employment limitations.\nDuring autumn, winter and spring quarters, enrolled graduate students are limited to 28 hours\nof student employment, combining hourly employment and assistantship appointments.\nInternational students are subject to additional limitations, see 2c. For example, graduate\nstudents appointed to 50% (20 hours/week) assistantships may not be employed more than an\nadditional eight hours/week; those additional hours cannot be in other assistantship positions.\nGraduate students with full fellowship funding are limited to additional employment of 8\nhours/week hourly employment or a 25% assistantship, but not both.\nDuring summer quarter, enrolled graduate students are limited to 36 hours of student\nemployment, combining hourly employment and assistantship appointments. International\nstudents may be subject to additional limitations, see 2c. For example, students on 50% (20\nhours/week) assistantships may not be employed more than an additional 16 hours a week;\nthose additional hours can combine either assistantships or hourly employment. In summer,\nstudents who are employed more than 8 hours with a 50% assistantship are expected to reduce\nthe number of units of enrollment commensurate with a larger percentage appointment, as\nshown in the TAL table for summer quarter (https://gfs.stanford.edu/salary/salary22/index.html)\n(https://gfs.stanford.edu/salary/salary22/index.html).

Additional Limits on Hours\nDuring break periods when school is officially not in session, Stanford does not limit the number\nof hours graduate students may be employed. Individual academic programs may define more\nrestrictive policies. Students must check with their academic program for any restrictions.\nFor on campus employment, university guidelines on overtime pay apply. Note that graduate\nstudent research and teaching assistantships are made for a full quarter of three months and\nhours associated with assistantships include these break periods. Policy related to assistantships\nis located in Administrative Guide 10.2.1: Graduate Student Assistantships\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-10/subchapter-2/policy-10-2-1)\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-10/subchapter-2/policy-10-2-1).\nInternational students must contact Bechtel International Center for information about off-campus\nemployment authorization (see Bechtel International Center’s website under “Employment\n(https://bechtel.stanford.edu/immigration/employment)\n(https://bechtel.stanford.edu/immigration/employment)”).\nIndividual university holidays, e.g., Presidents’ Day and Memorial Day, do not constitute a break\nas defined in this policy. Eligible break periods are defined below.\nThanksgiving Break. Restrictions on student work hours do not apply during Thanksgiving\nrecess, beginning the day after classes end (as detailed on the official university academic\ncalendar) and continuing through the day before classes resume.\nBetween-Quarter Breaks. Restrictions on student work hours do not apply beginning the day\nafter the final exam period ends ( detailed on the official university academic calendar) and\ncontinuing through the day before classes begin the following quarter. For example: students’\nemployment hours are not limited between the Saturday after autumn quarter final exams,\nthrough the Sunday before winter classes begin.\nSummer Quarter. Summer quarter employment rules vary depending upon student enrollment\nand visa status. Refer to the information and chart below for additional information.\nc. Additional Limits on Hours for International Students on F-1 or J-1 Visas\nInternational students on F-1 or J-1 visas are subject to both university policies on employment\nand visa regulations that limit employment; in all cases, the more restrictive limitation will apply.\nInternational students are eligible for on-campus employment if they are maintaining F-1 or J-1\nvisa status. J-1 students must obtain work authorization from the Bechtel International Center for\nboth on-campus and off-campus employment.\nDuring the academic year (autumn, winter and spring quarters), enrolled students on F-1or J-1\nvisas are limited to a total of 20 hours of employment per week (except during break periods),\nincluding on-campus hourly jobs, assistantship appointment(s), and any off-campus employment\nthat they may have been authorized to perform.\nDuring summer quarter, most international students are subject to the general university policies\nfor summer graduate student employment, and their F-1 or J-1 visa does not further restrict their\nhours of employment. However, any graduate student who is required to enroll full time in\nsummer quarter in order to maintain legal visa status, such as newly admitted students who will\nstart their program in the summer, or those students returning from a leave of absence in the\nsummer, may not work more than a combined total of 20 hours/week.\nDuring university defined break periods as defined in section 2b above, neither the university nor\nfederal regulations limit the number of hours international graduate students may be employed,\nprovided they are eligible and intend to register for the next academic quarter.\nFurther information regarding employment limits for students on F-1 or J-1 visas is available from\nthe Bechtel International Center (https://bechtel.stanford.edu/navigate-international-life/visas/f-1-\nand-j-1-student-visas) (https://bechtel.stanford.edu/).\nTable 1: Maximum Number of Hours of Hourly Employment Permitted per\nWeek\nFunding source or the student’s academic department/program may impose stricter limits.\nFootnotes describe the related limitations on enrollment.\nSTUDENT\nSTATUS\nFUNDING\nSTATUS    \n 50%\nASSISTANTSHIP1\nASSISTANTSHIP\nBETWEEN 10-\n40%\nFULL\nFELLOWSHIP\nNO OTHER\nGRADUATE\nFUNDING\nACADEMIC\nYEAR\n(ENROLLED\nSTUDENTS)\n    \nU.S. Citizen or\nLegal Permanent\nResident\n8 hours\n28 hours minus\nhours of\nassistantship\n8 hours or 25%\nassistantship,\nbut not both\n28 hours\nF-1 or J-1 student\nVisa holders 0 hours\n20 hours minus\nhours of\nassistantship\n8 hours or 25%\nassistantship,\nbut not both\n20 hours\nSUMMER\n(ENROLLED\nSTUDENTS)\n    \nU.S. Citizen or\nLegal Permanent\n16 hours 36 hours minus\nhours of\n16 hours or\n50% 36 hours.3\nSTUDENT\nSTATUS\nFUNDING\nSTATUS    \n 50%\nASSISTANTSHIP1\nASSISTANTSHIP\nBETWEEN 10-\n40%\nFULL\nFELLOWSHIP\nNO OTHER\nGRADUATE\nFUNDING\nACADEMIC\nYEAR\n(ENROLLED\nSTUDENTS)\n    \nResident; F-1 or\nJ-1 student visa\nholders whose\nvisa does not\nrequire full-time\nenrollment.\nassistantship2 assistantship,\nbut not both\nF-1 or J-1 student\nVisa holders\nwhose visa\nrequires full-time\nenrollment.4\n0 hours\n20 hours minus\nhours of\nassistantship\n16 hours or\n50%\nassistantship,\nbut not both\n20 hours\nBREAK AND\nNON-\nENROLLMENT\nPERIODS\n    \nU.S. student\nNo university limits -\nSee Section 2.b.\nabove\n   \nF-1 or J-1 student\nVisa holders\nNo university limits -\nSee Section 2.b.\nabove\n   \n1. Students with a 50% assistantship are limited to 10 units, TGR, or graduation quarter\nenrollment.\n2. In summer, students are expected to reduce enrollment below full-time status if they accept\nan assistantship of more than 50%, or they accept a combination of assistantship and\nhourly work that total more than 28 hours per week.\n3. Enrolled students cannot work more than 36 hours a week. More than 36 hours per week\nrequires the student not be enrolled and hired as a contingent (casual or temporary)\nemployee through Human Resources.\n4. Some international students are required to enroll full-time due to visa requirements and\nimmigration law (see Enrollment Requirements (https://bechtel.stanford.edu/navigate-\ninternational-life/visas/f-1-and-j-1-student-visas/maintaining-status-f-1-and-j-1-0)\n(https://bechtel.stanford.edu/navigate-international-life/visas/f-1-and-j-1-student-\nvisas/maintaining-status-f-1-and-j-1-0) on the Bechtel International Center website).\nStudents should consult with Bechtel International Center regarding their individual\nenrollment requirements.\n3. Hiring, Paying and Supervising Students\na. Hiring\nThe supervisor notifies the human resources administrator to make the appropriate system entry.\nThe students should be hired into the appropriate job classification code (JCC). The student\nmust be hired into PeopleSoft HR before beginning work. Students who are hired during summer\nquarter, but who are not enrolled, must be hired as student hourly employees using the\nappropriate summer student JCC. This step is required even if the student is continuing a work\nassignment that started during the academic year.\nBefore hiring a graduate student for hourly employment, a graduate student assistantship, or any\nother type of appointment through Human Resources the hiring department should contact the\nstudent’s academic home department/program to review the appointment (see the GFS School\ncontact (http://financialaid.stanford.edu/faculty_staff/gfs/contacts.html)\n(http://financialaid.stanford.edu/faculty_staff/gfs/contacts.html) list). The hourly appointment must\nbe reviewed for eligibility, taking into account:\nthe student’s academic obligations, including course load, number of registered units, and\nother expectat",

    "text": "cts.html) list). The hourly appointment must\nbe reviewed for eligibility, taking into account:\nthe student’s academic obligations, including course load, number of registered units, and\nother expectations;\nother forms of financial support that the student is receiving, including fellowships and\nassistantships (funding sources may impose limits on hourly employment);\nany limits that the student’s home academic department/program imposes (e.g., program\nmay limit hourly student employment); and\nlimitations placed on international students.\nStudents who receive a university award that includes funding to hire graduate students to\ncomplete hourly work (e.g., coding, transcription, or other effort associated with academic\nprojects) are subject to these policies. In such cases, the department should manage the funding\nand hire the student hourly employee.\nb. Wage rates\nFor hourly employment covered by the collective bargaining agreement, refer to the applicable\nagreement at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/workplace-essentials/policies/labor-relations-collective-\nbargaining). For non-bargaining unit members, there is no suggested hourly wage rate.\nWhen setting the hourly wage rate for a graduate student, the following may be taken into\nconsideration:\n The tasks required of the student, including the level of independence, judgment, and\nexpertise;\nThe student’s experience in similar work assignments;\nWage rate paid to other graduate students in the department for comparable work.\nConsult the graduate student hourly job classification codes (JCCs)\n(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yGLF4PscBVmAAPoTF0uQpr3kgPcbrjhzap_iBV05-\njc/edit?usp=sharing) for more information.\nc. Payment\nDepartments pay graduate students in hourly employment from their own sources of funding.\nHourly student workers must record actual hours worked in their Axess Timecard each pay\nperiod. Each month has two pay periods: The first day of the month through the 15th, and the\n16th through the last day of the month. Paychecks are issued on the workday that falls on or\nimmediately prior to the seventh calendar day after the end of each pay period.\nd. Supervision\nOne person should be named as the student’s immediate supervisor and should be directly\naccountable for overseeing the student’s work and approving the hours worked in Axess.\ne. Work Schedules and Requirements\nA graduate student in hourly employment is expected to establish a schedule of working hours, \nexercise punctuality, and abide by professional guidelines as established by the hiring\ndepartment with regard to performance and behavior. Most on-campus employers build in some\nflexibility in hours given students’ exam schedules, but that is not always possible, and students\nare expected to carry through if they have agreed to be at work.\nf. Sick Time\nSick time provides a mechanism to pay graduate student hourly employees when they are\nunable to perform their work responsibilities due to illness or for other related reasons, as\ndetailed below. All Stanford graduate students in hourly employment receive sick time benefits.\nArrangements for any variations in work hours, including time off for illness or related uses of\nsick time, should be made individually with the student hourly employee’s supervisor. To the\nextent possible, students in hourly employment are encouraged to make arrangements outside\nof their working hours, and supervisors are encouraged to offer flexibility in work hours.\nFor information about the accrual and use of sick time for student hourly employees, see\nAdministrative Guide Memo 10.3.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-10/subchapter-\n3/policy-10-3-1) (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-10/subchapter-3/policy-10-3-1): Sick\nTime for Student Hourly Employees.\ng. Job Listing\nStanford departments wishing to hire graduate students may use Handshake\n(https://stanford.joinhandshake.com), the system administered by Stanford Career Education\n(CareerEd), to list their job openings. Departments may also use their own means of recruiting\nand identifying student employees.\nh. Non-Discrimination\nNon-discrimination policies applicable to regular staff, as stated in Guide Memo 2.1.2, section\n2.a. (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-2/subchapter-1/policy-2-1-2#anchor-22831)\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-2/subchapter-1/policy-2-1-2#anchor-22831), also apply\nto student employees.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-employment-and-\nassistantships/graduate-student-employment-campus/graduate-0",

    "text": "10.3.1 Sick Time for Student Hourly\nEmployees\nAuthority\nThis Guide Memo was approved by the Vice President for Human Resources.\nLast Updated\nJanuary 28, 2025\nThis Guide Memo summarizes paid sick time accrual and usage policies for Stanford student\nhourly employees.\nApplicability:\nApplies to all Stanford undergraduate student employees as defined in Administrative Guide\nMemo 10.1.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-employment-and-\nassistantships/undergraduate-student-employment-campus-0): Undergraduate Student\nEmployment on Campus and Stanford graduate student hourly employees as defined in\nAdministrative Guide Memo 10.2.2 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-\nemployment-and-assistantships/graduate-student-employment-campus/graduate-0): Graduate\nStudent Hourly Employment. This policy is effective starting on July 1, 2015.\n1. Sick Time Benefits\nSick time provides a mechanism to pay student hourly employees when they are unable to\nperform their scheduled work responsibilities due to illness or for other related reasons as\ndetailed below. All Stanford “student hourly employees” (as defined in section 2. Definitions,\nbelow) receive sick time benefits. Arrangements for any variations in work hours, including time\noff for illness or related uses of sick time, should be made individually with the student hourly\nemployee’s supervisor. To the extent possible, student hourly employees are encouraged to\nmake arrangements outside of their working hours and supervisors are encouraged to offer\nflexibility in work hours.\n2. Definitions\nAll Stanford undergraduate and graduate students who are hired on an hourly basis are referred\nto as “student hourly employees” in this policy. This Administrative Guide Memo applies to\nStanford students hired on an hourly basis as defined in Administrative Guide Memo 10.1.1\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-employment-and-\nassistantships/undergraduate-student-employment-campus-0): Undergraduate Student\nEmployment and Administrative Guide Memo 10.2.2\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-employment-and-assistantships/graduate-\nstudent-employment-campus/graduate-0): Graduate Student Hourly Employment. Graduate\nstudents hired in an assistantship appointment (see Administrative Guide Memo 10.2.1\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-employment-and-assistantships/graduate-\nstudent-employment-campus/graduate-student): Graduate Student Assistantships) and\nPostdoctoral Fellows and Postdoctoral Research Affiliates (see Administrative Guide Memo 2.2.1\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/definitions): Definitions) are not student hourly employees.\n3. Accrual and Recording of Sick Time\na. Accrual of Sick Time\nStudent hourly employees accrue sick time as follows:\nStudent hourly employees accrue sick time at the rate of .03334 hours per hour worked.\nThis equates to one (1) hour of sick time for every 30 hours worked.\nUnused sick time accumulates from year to year, with a maximum limit of 80 hours or ten\n(10) days.\nStudent hourly employees accrue sick time for all hourly jobs worked at Stanford,\nregardless of the department of employment. When a student hourly employee leaves one\nposition and accepts another position within the University, the student hourly employee’s\nsick time balance is maintained as long as the new position starts within 12 months of the\ndate of termination from the first position. If the new position is not a student hourly\nemployee position, the student hourly employee is subject to any sick time policies\napplicable to the new position, including, without limitation, any policies regarding sick time\nuse and limits on sick time accruals.\nb. Recording Sick Time Accrual\nA student hourly employee’s accrued sick time is recorded in Axess\n(https://axess.stanford.edu)with the sick time balance reported on the student hourly employee’s\npay statement.\n4. Use of Sick Time\nSick time is paid only when used to replace scheduled work hours during the course of\nemployment. Otherwise, sick time balances are not paid out.\nArrangements for any variations in work hours, including time off for illness or related uses of\nsick time, should be made individually with the student hourly employee’s supervisor. To the\nextent possible, student hourly employees are encouraged to schedule appointments at a time\noutside of working hours. Where flexible schedules are possible, supervisors are encouraged to\naccommodate appointments by flexing a student hourly employee’s work hours.\nStudent hourly employees are entitled to use accrued sick time beginning on the 90th calendar\nday after the start of employment. Sick time must be accrued before it can be used. The use of\nsick time is limited to 40 hours or five scheduled work days, whichever is greater, each year of\nemployment. Sick time may only be used for an absence that a student hourly employee has\nduring scheduled work hours.\nSick time is not paid out when a student hourly employee ends employment for any reason,\nincluding, without limitation, no longer being employed in a student hourly employee position,\nleaving the University for any reason, taking a leave of absence, or being in non-enrollment\nstatus.\nSick time may be used for the following reasons:\na. Absence Due to Illness or Injury\nSick time may be used when a student hourly employee’s illness or injury prevents the student\nhourly employee from working.\nb. Medical and Dental Appointments\nSick time may be used for all medical and dental appointments, including:\nDiagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition\nPreventive care\nThose appointments associated with a work injury (e.g., physical therapy)\nc. Qualifying acts of violence\n“Qualifying act of violence” means any of the following, regardless of whether anyone is arrested\nfor, prosecuted for, or convicted of committing any crime:\n(A) Domestic violence\n(B) Sexual assault\n(C) Stalking\n(D) An act, conduct, or pattern of conduct that includes any of the following:\n(i) In which an individual causes bodily injury or death to another individual.\n(ii) In which an individual exhibits, draws, brandishes, or uses a firearm, or other dangerous\nweapon, with respect to another individual.\n(iii) In which an individual uses, or makes a reasonably perceived or actual threat to use, force\nagainst another individual to cause physical injury or death.\nSick time may be used by a student hourly employee who is a victim of or who has a family\nmember who is a victim of a qualifying act of violence in order to:\nObtain or attempt to obtain any relief, including, but not limited to, a temporary restraining\norder, restraining order, or other injunctive relief, to help ensure the health, safety, or\nwelfare of the victim or their child\nObtain or attempt to obtain any relief for the family member, including but not limited to a\ntemporary restraining order, restraining order, or other injunctive relief, to help ensure the\nhealth, safety, or welfare of the family member of the victim\nSeek, obtain, or assist a family member to seek or obtain medical attention for or to recover\nfrom injuries caused by a qualifying act of violence\nSeek, obtain, or assist a family member to seek or obtain services from a domestic\nviolence shelter, program, rape crisis center, or victim services organization or agency as a\nresult of a qualifying act of violence\nSeek, obtain, or assist a family member to seek or obtain psychological counseling or\nmental health services related to a qualifying act of violence \nParticipate in safety planning and take other actions to increase safety from future\nqualifying acts of violence\nRelocate or engage in the process of securing a new residence due to the qualifying act of\nviolence, including, but not limited to, securing temporary or permanent housing or enrolling\nchildren in a new school or child care\nProvide care to a family member who is recovering from injuries caused by a qualif",

Family Sick Time\nStudent hourly employees may use sick time for diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing\nhealth condition of, or preventive care for, a student hourly employee’s family member or for any\npurpose in accordance with section 2.c. above that is for a family member. For the purpose of\nthis policy, a family member includes the student hourly employee’s:\nSpouse or registered domestic partner\nChildren of the student hourly employee or spouse or registered domestic partner\n(including a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child to whom the\nstudent hourly employee stands in loco parentis, regardless of the child’s age or\ndependency status)\nParents and parents-in-law (including a biological, adoptive, or foster parent, stepparent, or\nlegal guardian of a student hourly employee or the student hourly employee’s spouse or\nregistered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the student\nhourly employee was a minor)\nBrothers and sisters\nGrandparents or grandchildren\nStudent hourly employees may use up to 40 hours or five (5) days of their accrued sick time for\ndiagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a\ndesignated person, or for any purpose in accordance with section 2.c. above that is for the\ndesignated person. “Designated person” means a person identified by the student hourly\nemployee at the time the student hourly employee requests paid sick days. A student hourly\nemployee is limited to one “designated person” per 12-month period for such paid sick days.\n5. Administration\na. Notification of Absence\nThe student hourly employee reports an absence (or planned absence) to the supervisor. The\ndepartment is responsible for establishing and communicating rules on how student hourly\nemployees notify the department of absences. If the need for sick time use is foreseeable, the\nstudent hourly employee should provide reasonable advance notice. If the need for sick time use\nis unforeseeable, the student hourly employee should provide notice of the need for sick time\nuse as soon as practicable. If a student hourly employee requests to use accrued sick time and\nthe student hourly employee’s use of sick time is within applicable limits per year of employment,\nthe request should not be denied because details are not provided about the sick time use.\nTo the extent possible, student hourly employees are encouraged to schedule appointments\noutside of working hours. Where flexible schedules are possible, supervisors are encouraged to\naccommodate appointments by flexing a student hourly employee’s work hours.\nb. Medical Confirmation\n(1) Medical confirmation related to use of sick time\nAcceptable medical evidence may be required for the use of sick time. However, for a student\nhourly employee's use of the first 40 hours of sick time (or five scheduled work days, whichever\nis greater) during each year of employment, excepting circumstances involving abuse or misuse\nof sick time as stated in subpart (2) below, supervisors may not require acceptable medical\nevidence, and supervisors should not deny sick time use based on a student hourly employee's\nfailure to provide details about the sick time use. The supervisor who approves the use of sick\ntime is responsible for confirming that the conditions for the use of sick time are met.\n(2) Medical confirmation related to possible abuse or misuse of sick time\nIf the University has a reasonable basis to believe that a student hourly employee may have\nengaged in abuse or misuse of sick time at any time (even during the first 40 hours or five\nscheduled workdays of sick time use during each year of employment), the University may ask\nfor acceptable medical evidence or other proof showing that a student hourly employee has not\nengaged in abuse or misuse of sick time. Abuse or misuse of sick time, failure to follow sick time\nnotification procedures (i.e., failing to provide reasonable advance notice for foreseeable sick\ntime use, not providing requested medical information when abuse or misuse is suspected, or\nnot giving notice as soon as practicable for unforeseeable sick time use) may be a basis for\ndiscipline, up to and including termination of employment. Also, use of sick time may be denied if\nthere is abuse or misuse of sick time.\n(3) Acceptable medical evidence\nAcceptable medical evidence includes, but is not limited to, a health care practitioner’s statement\nthat certifies a medical need for sick time, the expected duration of absence and anticipated\nreturn to work date, and any work-related limitations or restrictions (including the duration of\nthose limitations or restrictions) when the student hourly employee is released to return to work.\nc. Reporting Sick Time Use\nStudent hourly employees record hours of sick time used in the Axess timecard each pay period.\nStudent hourly employees may only be paid for the number of sick time hours that they have\naccrued, and which is available to them. The use of sick time is limited to 40 hours or five\nscheduled work days each year of employment, whichever is greater. Up to 40 hours of sick time\nuse may be recorded in Axess; if a student hourly employee has five scheduled work days of sick\ntime use that exceeds 40 hours, the student hourly employee should request assistance from the\nlocal Human Resources office. Student hourly employees are not paid for time spent away from\nwork in excess of the sick time limit per year of employment, and such time is not recorded in\nAxess. For information about Axess see this Time & Leave System overview\n(http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payemployee/time_leave_reporting.html) on the\nFingate website.\nd. Sick Time Credit Date\nSick time must be accrued before it can be used. Sick time is credited at the beginning of each\nmonth of service, calculated based on work hours recorded during the previous month. If a\nstudent hourly employee needs to use sick time that has been accrued but not yet credited in\nAxess, the student hourly employee should speak to the local Human Resources office for\nassistance.\ne. Tax Status\nThe income that the student hourly employee receives for sick time is taxable. Applicable taxes\nare deducted.\nf. Multiple Forms of Employment\nStudent hourly employees who are employed by Stanford in other ways are affected as follows:\nAssistantships: Graduate students who have assistantship appointments, either\nconcurrently or at different times of the year, will see a separate accounting of sick time\naccrued for the assistantship appointment. (For more information, see Administrative Guide\nMemo 10.2.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/10-2-1): Graduate Student Assistantships)\nTemporary or casual employment: Students who are hired as temporary or casual\nemployees in the same 12-month period in which they were student hourly employees will\nhave previously accrued sick time, up to the applicable limits, available for use. Temporary\nor casual employment for students typically occurs in summer, following graduation, or\nwhen a student is on a leave of absence\nScholarship, fellowship, and stipend",

Sources of Funds for Sick Time\nAs sick time is used to replace scheduled work time, it should be recorded in Axess on the\ntimecard associated with the job for which the work time was scheduled. Sick time used is\ncharged to the department that owns this job record. Departments employing a student on\nFederal Work Study must provide their own unrestricted funding to pay for sick time when used.\nThis unrestricted PTA should be recorded on the timecard as sick time is used.\nh.

For policies that apply to\nemployees covered by collective bargaining agreements, refer to the applicable agreements\nbetween Stanford University and SEIU Higher Education Workers Local 2007 and Stanford\nUniversity and the Stanford Deputy Sheriffs' Association. Agreements can be found at Labor\nRelations & Collective Bargaining (http://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/hr-processes-policies/labor-\nrelations-collective-bargaining). \n1. Retirement Plans\na. University Retirement Plans\nIncome from University retirement plans is available to all participants who are vested in these\nplans, whether or not they are Official University Retirees. For detailed information about\neligibility, contributions, vesting, and benefits please see each plan's Summary Plan Description,\navailable at the Benefits (http://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards) web site. The\nSummary Plan Description is the official University communication on these plans and contains a\ndescription of how each plan operates and participants' rights under the plan and federal law.\nStaff Retirement Annuity Plan (SRAP) - This retirement plan is for certain employees\ncovered by collective bargaining unit agreements. Additionally, due to certain historical Plan\nprovision changes and participant elections, some exempt and nonexempt staff may either:\n(a) Be a current participant in SRAP, or(b) Have an accrued SRAP benefit from previous\nparticipation while in an active SRAP status.\nStanford Contributory Retirement Plan (SCRP) - This retirement plan is for faculty,\nacademic staff and exempt and non-exempt employees. However, due to certain plan\nprovision changes and participant elections, some employees elected to continue\nparticipation in SRAP rather than participate in SCRP. The Summary Plan Description is\navailable on the Benefits (http://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards)web site in\nthe Resource Library.\nb. Voluntary Tax-Deferred Annuity Plan (TDA)\nThis retirement plan is available to all eligible employees immediately upon hire and is intended\nto supplement the retirement benefits from Social Security and either the SRAP or SCRP plans.\nFor purposes of this plan, \"employee\" includes faculty and staff; post doctoral scholars; and\ntemporary, casual and contingent employees. Employees make tax-deferred contributions to this\nsupplemental plan and direct where to invest their contributions.\nc. Social Security Retirement Benefits \nThe Social Security program provides retirement benefits to individuals who have worked long\nenough in covered employment to become fully insured. Reduced benefits are payable to\nretirees starting at age 62 and before Social Security normal retirement age based on year of\nbirth. Increased benefits result from deferring retirement beyond normal retirement age. After the\nstart of benefits, amounts earned from gainful employment in excess of limits set by law may\nreduce Social Security payments. Employees and employers pay the costs of the Social Security\nprogram. Local offices of the Social Security Administration will provide additional information\nand assistance with applications for benefits.\n2. Official University Retirees\na. Eligibility\nOnly current employees and former employees who have not been terminated for gross\nmisconduct (and informed in writing that they are ineligible for rehire by the University) may\nqualify to become an Official University Retiree if age and service requirements are met.\n1.

    "text": "2.1.11 Staff Grievance Policy\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Human Resources.\nLast Updated\nNovember 15, 2022\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 22.10\nThis Guide Memo outlines the policy to resolve staff employee complaints at Stanford through a\nformal grievance process and is designed specifically for regular employees as defined in the\n\"Applicability\" section. The Staff Grievance Process is intended to supplement, not replace,\nroutine and informal methods of responding to and resolving employee complaints.\nThe Staff Grievance Process (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hilv_8caKlDe-\nCdFot7MwBgBH9uxE_kS/view) is located in the Grievance/Appeal Processes section\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/working-stanford/grievanceappeal-processes) of the Cardinal\nat Work website.\nEmployee complaints covered by the Staff Grievance Process include written\ncorrective actions that are placed in an employee’s personnel file (e.g., written\nwarnings) and involuntary terminations (including layoffs) only. The Staff Grievance\nProcess does not apply to employee complaints regarding other issues such as\nperformance appraisals, Performance Improvement Plans, compensation/benefits or job\nclassifications. Information regarding resources to address workplace concerns can be\nfound in the Address Concerns (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/working-stanford/address-\nconcerns) section of the Cardinal at Work website.\nApplicability:\nApplies to all regular employees as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/definitions): Definitions.\nIt does not apply to:\nTrial period employees (see Guide Memo 2.1.15, Trial Period\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/trial-\nperiod))\nCasual or temporary employees\nEmployees covered by collective bargaining agreements, found at Labor Relations &\nCollective Bargaining (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/hr-processes-policies/labor-\nrelations-collective-bargaining). \nAcademic Staff – Research (see Research Policy Handbook\n(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/non-faculty-research-\nappointments/grievance-procedure-academic-staff#anchor-1016))\nAcademic Staff – Teaching (see Research Policy Handbook\n(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/non-faculty-research-\nappointments/grievance-procedure-academic-staff#anchor-1016))\nAcademic Staff – Libraries (see Policy Manual for Academic Staff-Libraries)\nSenior staff (see Guide Memo 2.1.14 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-\nresources/staff-employment-policies/senior-staff))\nFaculty (see Faculty Handbook (http://facultyhandbook.stanford.edu/))\nIf a trial period, casual, or temporary employee who is involuntarily terminated has concerns\nand/or feedback regarding their employment, they may contact the local Human Resources\nOffice or University Human Resources/Employee & Labor Relations.\n1. Informal Resolution\nRegular and effective communication between supervisors and employees reduces the likelihood\nof misunderstanding and conflict. Stanford University expects and encourages supervisors and\nemployees to communicate openly and regularly so that the interests of the employee and the\nuniversity are best served. To support this commitment, the university has this Staff Grievance\nProcess and resource offices such as the local Human Resources Office, University Human\nResources/Employee & Labor Relations, the Faculty Staff Help Center and the Office of the\nOmbuds to assist employees in resolving employee complaints.\nBefore initiating Step 1 of the Staff Grievance Process, the employee is strongly encouraged to\nmake at least one informal attempt to resolve their concerns. If the employee feels uncomfortable\nin attempting to do this by him/herself, assistance is available through the local Human\nResources Office, University Human Resources/Employee & Labor Relations, the Faculty Staff\nHelp Center, or the Office of the Ombuds.\n2. Formal Staff Grievance Process\nIf the employee is unsuccessful in resolving their complaint informally, they may file a formal\ngrievance with University Human Resources/Employee & Labor Relations. The Staff Grievance\nProcess (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S7TypvsqUNcSKFngDrY5h1QB2Zgrv1vB/view) and\nother information is located in the Grievance/Appeal Processes\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/working-stanford/grievanceappeal-processes) section of the\nCardinal at Work website.\n3. Representation and Support\na. Self-Representation\nThe employee will act as their own representative at each step in the Staff Grievance Process.\nb. Support Person\nIn the case of a grievance that is heard by a Grievance Advisory Board, the employee may\nchoose to have a support person accompany them to the grievance hearing. The employee may\nselect any one university employee who:\nis not employed as an attorney\nis both willing and able to attend the hearing without impairing their own work duties, and\nreceives their supervisor's approval\nc. Outside Representation\nThe Staff Grievance Process does not allow for outside representation of any kind at any step of\nthe process. If at any time before or during the Staff Grievance Process the employee chooses to\nelect action related to the grievance issue(s) outside of the internal process (such as filing a\ncharge with the EEOC, California Civil Rights Department, other administrative body, or a\nlawsuit), the Staff Grievance Process will be terminated without any decision being reached.\n4. Time Frames\nAll times frames indicated in the Staff Grievance Process are computed in calendar days unless\nnoted otherwise. All parties involved in the Staff Grievance Process must adhere to the time\nframes specified. Exceptions to this rule will be handled on a case-by-case basis and must be\napproved by the Vice President of Human Resources (or designee). The period of the Winter\nClose is excluded from the time frames.\n5. Administration\nUniversity Human Resources/Employee & Labor Relations have primary responsibility for\nadministering and coordinating the Staff Grievance Process. In addition, University Human\nResources/Employee & Labor Relations is the primary source of assistance for employees and\nsupervisors who have questions or concerns pertaining to the Staff Grievance Process.\n6. Protection Against Retaliation\nNo adverse action may be taken against any employee because of their good faith participation\nin the Staff Grievance Process. An adverse action is any action that materially affects that\nindividual’s terms and conditions of employment.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/staff-grievance-policy",

Tuition Payment\nPayment of tuition and covered fees through STRP will be made directly to the institution before\nattendance each quarter or semester.\n4. Allowable Expenses\nAn employee may not receive reimbursement under STAP and reimbursement under STRP for\nthe same course or program. For example, you cannot use STRP for tuition and STAP for books,\nsupplies and equipment for the same course or program.\na. STAP Expenses\nThe current maximum STAP reimbursement is:\n$800 for eligible employees not covered by the SEIU Collective Bargaining\nAgreement\n$700 for eligible employees covered by the SEIU Collective Bargaining Agreement\n$100 of STAP funds for SEIU-represented staff are reallocated for a leadership,\ntraining and educational program, known as the Apprenticeship Program. (For\nadditional information, refer to the 2014 Collective Bargaining Agreement\nbetween SEIU Higher Education Workers Local 2007 and The Board of\nTrustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, Side Letter 7: Leadership,\nTraining and Educational Fund).\nCosts of tuition, registration fees, and required textbooks, CDs, e-books, or tapes are\nallowable for reimbursement up to a maximum determined each fiscal year.\nTravel expenses, parking, lodging, meals, professional memberships, testing and exam\nfees, reference books, and professional subscriptions are not allowable.\nb.

Timing of STRP Payment\nPayment of tuition and covered fees will be made directly to the institution by the program\nadministrator before attendance each quarter or semester. If the employee makes payment\ndirectly to the institution, the employee must submit the invoice to the program administrator\nthrough a Direct Bill request. The program administrator will make payment directly to the\ninstitution, and the institution will issue a credit or reimbursement to the employee.\nc. Departmental Reimbursement\nWhen covered costs exceed the current STAP/STRP limit, the excess cost may be partially or\nfully reimbursed by the employee's department. Departmental reimbursement is at the\ndepartment's discretion and is determined based on available departmental funds for training.\nReimbursement for work-related or career development training may be taxable if the total\nexceeds $5,250 in one tax year (see Section 7a), regardless of the source of university funds.\nDepartmental reimbursements have the same tax consequences as STAP/STRP\nreimbursements.\nd. Employee Obligation\nWhen the university reimburses an employee for training costs through STAP prior to completion\nof the activity, the employee assumes an obligation to complete the supported training in a\nsatisfactory manner. An employee who does not complete university-reimbursed training must\nrepay the university the total amount of the reimbursement.\ne. Evidence of Satisfactory Completion\nEmployees utilizing funds for training expenses through STAP must provide the supervisor with\nevidence of satisfactory completion as soon as possible—but no later than 60 days after the\ntraining activity is completed. For STRP, evidence of satisfactory completion must be provided to\nboth the supervisor (if supervisor approval was required) and to EdAssist, the STRP\nadministration vendor, within 60 days of the course end date. Such evidence may be an official\ngrade card or transcript from the institution or provider of the course. Failure to submit evidence\nof course completion within 60 days will require the employee to repay the tuition/fee/expense\namount to Stanford and could result in the denial of all future requests for tuition assistance.\nRefer to the STRP Guidelines for details on the Evidence of Satisfactory Completion submission\nprocess.\nFor undergraduate academic courses using STRP funds, a grade C or better, or pass\ngrade in a pass/fail course is required. A grade of C- or less will not be accepted as a\nsatisfactory grade.\nFor graduate academic courses, using STRP funds, a grade B or better, or pass in a\npass/fail course is required. A grade of B- will not be accepted as a satisfactory grade.\nIf a course may be taken for either a letter grade or a pass/fail grade, the employee must\ntake the course for a letter grade to be eligible for STRP funds for this course.\nf. Repayments\nStaff members who have utilized STRP are required to repay tuition and fees that were paid to\nSTRP to an institution for coursework if: \nEmployee withdraws from a course after the tuition was paid\nEmployee fails to submit proof of satisfactory completion\nFor undergraduate course work, the employee receives a grade of C- or lower or Fail (if a\nPass/Fail course)\nFor graduate course work, the employee receives a grade B- or lower or Fail (if a Pass/Fail\ncourse)\n6. Application Process\na. STAP\nAn employee planning a training or development activity should discuss development and\nperformance objectives with their supervisor before registering for the course or program.\nDecisions regarding the applicability of training and issues regarding release time should be\nmade at this time. The employee and the supervisor should review career development plans\nbefore registration. No application form is needed.\nDepartmental Review\nThe supervisor should review the staff training assistance request and evidence of satisfactory\ncompletion, confirming the following:\nEmployee eligibility (see Section 1)\nProgram applicability (see Section 2 and 3)\nCovered fees and expenses (see Section 4)\nCourse completion (see Section 5)\nHealthy Living offerings or Stanford Continuing Studies Program (CSP) courses are not subject\nto supervisor approval unless release time is required.\nb.

The employee must make the request and submit\ndocumentation as proof of payment within 60 days of the course end date. Detailed information\nabout the application, payment, and reimbursement process can be found on the STRP website.\nc. Tuition & Training Programs Review\nThe Tuition & Training Programs office monitors and periodically audits applications for\nconformance with standards of eligibility, applicability, and allowability as outlined in this Guide\nMemo. The Tuition & Training Programs office has final approval over any disputes, of\napplication denial or denial of payment and reimbursements for approved applications. A\ndecision by the Tuition & Training Programs office concerning approval or disapproval of\napplications, payments, or reimbursements is not subject to review under any grievance\nprocedure. Appeal of a decision by the Tuition & Training Programs office may be made in writing\nto the Director of Tuition & Training Programs in University Human Resources.\n7. Termination of Employment\na. New Applications\nNo applications will be accepted after employment with the university or SLAC National\nAccelerator Laboratory ends.\nb. Expense Reimbursement\nIf employment with the university or SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory ends before a request\nfor reimbursement of covered expenses has been submitted, an employee may submit a manual\nrequest for reimbursement if the reason for termination is for any of the following reasons:\nLayoff\nLayoff to Retirement\nRetirement\nMilitary Service\nTransfer from the University to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\nTransfer from SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory to the university\nIf employment with the university or SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory ended for any other\nreason, an employee will not be eligible to request or receive reimbursement for expenses after\nthe date employment ended.  However, if an application was submitted and approved, and tuition\nand fees were paid directly to the employee’s school prior to the date employment ended for any\nreason, their will not be required to repay that amount.\n8. Tax Implications\nSDP is intended to provide benefits that are, to the extent possible, excluded from taxation under\nfederal and state laws. Accordingly, this Guide Memo constitutes a separate written plan for the\nexclusive benefit of employees under sections 127 and 132(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and\nits regulations, to provide such employees with educational assistance.\na. General Rule\nIn general, an employee may exclude up to $5,250 received for graduate or undergraduate\neducation under STRP and up to $800 received under STAP from their gross income each tax\nyear for allowable tuition and covered fees and expenses.\nb. Tax Year\nEmployees should note that STRP provides reimbursements of up to $5,250 for each Stanford\nfiscal year. Because Stanford's fiscal year runs from September 1 through August 31, an\nemployee could be eligible to receive reimbursements in excess of $5,250 for the employee's tax\nyear.\nc. Other Situations\nAmounts paid to an employee in excess of $5,250 may also be excluded if they are payments for\ncertain job-related training, when such training maintains or improves the skills of an employee.\nHowever, if the training is necessary for the employee to meet the minimum educational\nrequirements for employment, or if the training will qualify the employee for a new trade or\nbusiness, the payments will not qualify for this additional exclusion.\nd. Getting Help\nEmployees should consult their personal tax advisor with any questions.\n9. Status and Duration of Staff Development Program\na. Administration\nSDP is administered by the university. The university has the discretionary authority to determine\nall matters with respect to SDP, including, without limitation, eligibility issues, benefit amounts,\nevidentiary matters, and tax treatment. Its decisions shall be final and binding on all persons.\nb. Amendment and Termination\nThe university reserves the right to modify SDP in any respect, or to discontinue SDP, at any\ntime.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/staff-development-programs",

University policy does not require corrective action be taken in any formal steps or\norder, and recognizes that the determination of appropriate corrective action will depend on the\nfacts and circumstances of the particular situation. Moreover, some forms of conduct, including\nany form of gross misconduct, warrant immediate termination.\nRefer to Guide Memo 2.1.11 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-\nemployment-policies/staff-grievance-policy): Staff Grievance Policy for information regarding\ncorrective actions that can be grieved.\n2.

For policies that apply to employees covered\nby a collective bargaining agreement, refer to the agreements at Labor Relations & Collective\nBargaining (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/hr-processes-policies/labor-relations-collective-\nbargaining). Trial period and contingent (temporary and casual) employees are not eligible for\nlayoff benefits.\n1. Policy Statement\nLayoffs may be temporary or permanent, and may occur because of budgetary reasons, lack of\nwork, reorganization, or redefinition of the university’s or the department’s needs. The university\nshall determine when layoffs will occur, the administrative unit, department, or workgroup in\nwhich the layoff will occur (i.e., the layoff unit), and which position(s) are subject to layoff. Such\ndecisions are not subject to review. The layoff process and implementation must be carried out in\ncoordination with the local human resources manager with the approval of University Human\nResources - Employee & Labor Relations.\n2. Definitions\na. A temporary or seasonal layoff\nis the removal of a regular staff employee from work for a period not exceeding six months. A\ntemporary or seasonal layoff occurs when, in the judgment of the university, a temporary\nreduction in the workforce or of a particular kind of work is necessary within a particular layoff\nunit. There is no break in the continuity of university service during temporary or seasonal layoff.\nb. A permanent layoff\nis the separation from university employment of a regular staff employee who has completed the\ntrial period due to:\n1. the elimination of a position, or\n2. the reduction of a position to less than 75% time, or\n3. the reduction of a position from regular to non-regular status.\n3. Layoff Notice\na. Temporary or Seasonal Layoff\n1. Employees designated for temporary or seasonal layoff should be given at least two weeks’\n(14 calendar days’) notice in advance of the layoff date, except in cases of emergency or in\ncircumstances beyond the university’s control. If notice is provided orally, it should be\nfollowed with confirming written notice by no later than the actual date of layoff.\n2. The written notice must include the effective date of layoff and the date the employee is\ninstructed to return to work. Any change to the terms in the layoff notice should also be\nconfirmed in writing.\nb. Permanent Layoff\n1. Notice or Pay in Lieu of Notice: In cases of permanent layoff, the department must give\none month's (e.g., June 15 through July 15) written notice. In limited circumstances and\nwith approval from University Human Resources - Employee & Labor Relations,\ndepartments may give up to three months' written notice. In limited circumstances and with\napproval from University Human Resources - Employee & Labor Relations, departments\nmay give pay in lieu of notice. When pay is given in lieu of notice, one month is the\nmaximum period for which such payment can be made.\nc. Early Resignation\nIf an employee resigns after receiving written notification of permanent layoff and prior to the\neffective date of layoff, the balance of the notice period will not be converted to pay. However, the\nemployee remains eligible to receive severance pay in accordance with the terms of this policy\nand the schedule below (see section 6). Severance pay will be recalculated to reflect the last day\nof employment.\nd. Layoff of Academic Staff-Research and Academic Staff-Libraries\n1. When layoffs of Academic Staff-Research or Academic Staff-Libraries occur for\nprogrammatic reasons, the employee must be given three months’ written notice. When\npay is given in lieu of notice, three months is the maximum period for which such payment\ncan be made.\n2. When layoffs of Academic Staff-Research or Academic Staff-Libraries occur for non-\nprogrammatic reasons, such as lack of available financial support, the employee must be\ngiven at least one month’s written notice, but no more than three months' written notice, or\nwhen pay is given in lieu of notice, a maximum of one month's pay.\ne. Change in Layoff Status\nNotice of layoff to a regular staff employee may be changed in the following circumstances:\n1. Deferral of Layoff: A regular staff employee who is notified of layoff but has not yet been\nlaid off and who subsequently accepts work that is anticipated to last less than six months\nwill have their layoff date deferred to the end of the temporary assignment. Work can be\nwithin the same department or a different department. Layoff deferrals must be approved\nby University Human Resources - Employee & Labor Relations. A letter deferring the layoff\nmust be issued to the employee with the new layoff date. Each layoff can be deferred one\ntime only. If the employee resigns after notification of the deferral, they can receive\nseverance pay, which will be recalculated to reflect the last day of employment. Severance\npay is based on the employee’s rate of pay and percentage of full time in the position from\nwhich they were laid off.\n2. Rescission of Layoff: A regular staff employee who has received notice of layoff but has\nnot yet been laid off and subsequently is retained by the department either in the same, or\na substantially equivalent, regular, benefits-eligible position, will have their layoff rescinded.\nUnder these circumstances, the department shall give written notice to the employee that\ntheir layoff has been rescinded, after which the employee is no longer in \"layoff status,\" and\nwill not receive severance pay if they resign. An employee who resigns after receiving a\nletter of layoff rescission will be considered a \"voluntary resignation,\" unless the employee\nhas received a new notice of layoff. For any future staff reductions, the department should\nfollow the normal notice and layoff procedures of this Guide Memo.\n3. Rehire in a Different Department: A regular staff employee who has received notice of\nlayoff but has not yet been laid off and subsequently is hired by any Stanford University\ndepartment in a regular, benefits-eligible position will not receive severance pay. The\nposition selected for layoff will still be eliminated or reduced. \n4. Benefits and Time Off\na. Medical Plan Coverage\nStanford will continue its contribution to a laid-off employee's medical plan for the employee and\ntheir enrolled dependents during the first three months after layoff, provided the employee signs\nthe General Release of All Claims and Severance Repayment Agreement and (1) timely elects\nCOBRA and completes the necessary medical coverage selection and (2) timely pays any\ncontributions required of the employee. The laid-off employee is required to pay the full cost of\nthe plan coverage, plus the administrative fee for coverage after the first three months of COBRA\ncoverage. For temporary or seasonal layoffs, the university will make contributions to the\nemployee’s medical plan and life insurance plan, subject to prompt payment of any required\ncontributions by the employee during the layoff period (up to six months).\nb.

Dental and Vision Coverage\nThe laid-off employee pays the full cost of COBRA coverage, plus administrative fees, for dental\nand vision, beginning with the first day of COBRA eligibility. The university makes no contribution.\nc. Vacation and Sick Leave:\nA regular staff employee who has received notice of layoff may accrue vacation and sick leave in\nany month in which the employee receives pay. During temporary or seasonal layoff, vacation\nand sick leave accrue as if the employee were continuing to work regular time (please see Guide\nMemo 2.1.6: Vacations (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-\nemployment-policies/vacations) and Guide Memo 2.1.7: Sick Time: Regular Staff Employees,\nRegular Academic Staff-Research and Regular Academic Staff-Professional Librarians\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/sick-time-\nregular-staff-employees-regular)). The employee may use accumulated vacation, PTO, and\nfloating holiday during temporary or seasonal layoff.\nd. Floating Holiday/Personal Time Off\nA regular staff employee who has received notice of layoff but has not yet been laid off will have\nfloating holiday hours and personal time off made available on January 1 in accordance with\nGuide Memo 2.1.13: Paid Holidays (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-\nresources/staff-employment-policies/paid-holidays) and Guide Memo 2.1.8: Miscellaneous\nAuthorized Absences (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-\nemployment-policies/miscellaneous-authorized-absences).\ne. Holiday Pay/Time Off:\nA regular staff employee who has received notice of layoff may receive holiday pay for any month\nin which the employee receives pay, and in which the employee is on paid status on the day\npreceding and the day following the university designated holiday. When the employee is on a\ntemporary or seasonal layoff period not exceeding 25 calendar days, regular holiday pay for\nthe employee's normally scheduled number of hours will be paid upon the employee's return to\nwork; see Guide Memo 2.1.13: Paid Holidays (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-\nresources/staff-employment-policies/paid-holidays).\nf. Outplacement Services\nRegular staff employees whose employment terminates due to permanent layoff will be eligible\nfor three months of outplacement services to commence within six months of the date the\nemployee receives written notification of their layoff. The outplacement services shall be provided\nby an outplacement agency designated by the university, in its sole discretion, and the cost for\nsuch services shall be borne by the university in an amount to be determined from time to time,\nwith additional amounts, if any, to be paid by the department from which the employee was laid\noff and approved by the Vice President for Human Resources (or designee).\ng. Employees Who Are Concurrently Notified of Layoff from the University\nand Offered a Position at Stanford Health Care or Lucile Packard Children’s\nHospital\nA regular staff employee who concurrently receives notification from the university of a\npermanent layoff and an offer of employment with Stanford Health Care or Lucile Packard\nChildren’s Hospital, and who accepts such offer of employment is not eligible for the severance\npay, COBRA contributions, or other layoff benefits described in Sections 4 and 6.\n5. Selection for Layoff\na. Temporary or Seasonal Layoff\nManagement of the administrative unit, workgroup, or department decides which employees will\nbe placed on temporary or seasonal layoff. The Dean of Research will review all cases involving\nsenior research associates or research associates.\nb. Permanent Layoff\n1. Prior to providing notice of layoff to a regular staff employee within the layoff unit, the\nuniversity should consider terminating temporary and trial period employees, provided the\nemployees remaining in the layoff unit possess sufficient skills and abilities to do the work\nrequired. The elimination or reduction of a position as determined above will not result in a\nnotice of layoff if:\na. The position is occupied by an employee still in the trial period, in which case the\nemployee undergoes termination during the trial period (see Guide Memo 2.1.15: Trial\nPeriod (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/trial-period)), or\nb. The position is occupied by a fixed-term employee whose fixed-term of employment\nconcludes at the same time as the position is eliminated or reduced, or\nc. The position is occupied by a contingent employee, in which case the contingent\nemployee will be terminated, or\nd. The position is occupied by an employee who accepts alternate university employment\nprior to the effective date of the layoff.\nExcept in the above four cases, the elimination or reduction of a position may result in a\nnotice of layoff.\n2. Management will determine the selection of employees for layoff or retention based on its\njudgment of the current and prospective operational and performance requirements in the\nlayoff unit, and whether the affected employee's demonstrated performance, knowledge,\nskills, and abilities meet those requirements.\n3. When management deems that the performance, knowledge, skills, and abilities of\nemployees necessary to meet the current and prospective operational and performance\nrequirements are substantially equal, then length of continuous employment with the\nuniversity and the university's affirmative action commitments will be considered in\nselecting employees for layoff, reassignment, or retention.\n4. Failure to Return to Work: If an employee on temporary or seasonal layoff fails to return\nto work when scheduled to return to work or when recalled to work, the employee shall be\ndeemed to have resigned unless an additional leave of absence is requested and approved\nin advance of the return date. Written notice of termination must be given to the employee\nno later than the termination date and must include the date of termination and notice of the\nemployee's right to apply for unemployment compensation benefits.\n5. Reemployment from Layoff Status: An employee who has received notice of permanent\nlayoff and who applies for other employment within the university will have an employment\npreference for hiring purposes (see Guide Memo 2.1.2: Recruiting & Hiring of Regular\nStaff).  (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/recruiting-and-hiring-regular-staff)\n6. Severance Pay\na. Severance Payment\nEach eligible regular staff employee with one year or more of continuous university employment\nis eligible to receive severance pay on the date of permanent layoff in accordance with the\nSeverance Pay Table below, provided a signed General Release of All Claims and Severance\nRepayment Agreement is executed and the Agreement’s revocation period, if any, has expired.\nSeverance payment generally is made on the last day of employment or within five working days\nafter expiration of any revocation period in the General Release of All Claims and Severance\nRepayment Agreement, whichever is later.\nb. Calculating Severance Pay\nAn employee will not receive severance pay more than once for the same period of service with\nthe university. To calculate future severance pay eligibility for an employee who was previously\nlaid off:\n1. Determine the severance pay eligibility (in months of base pay) from the table below.\n2. Subtract the eligibility corresponding to the number of months of severance pay previously\nreceived.\n3. Add back in any months or partial months of severance pay previously repaid to the\nuniversity (see Section 6(c)).\nFor purposes of any future severance calculation for a subsequent layoff, an employee who has\nreceived severance pay under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement and who is\nreemployed by the university in a position that is not c",

Repayment of Severance Pay\nThe months following the layoff effective date comprise the \"severance repayment period.\" This\nperiod is equal to the number of months of severance pay received. If an employee is\nreemployed by the university as a regular benefits-eligible employee before the end of the\nseverance repayment period, that portion of the severance pay equal to the base pay they would\nhave earned if not terminated may be retained by the employee. Severance repayment will be\nprorated for an employee rehired into a position with a lower percentage time commitment or\nlower rate of pay than the position from which the employee was laid off. The balance of the\nseverance pay is to be repaid in full at the time of reemployment, unless the employee\nauthorizes and the university approves a reasonable schedule of repayment and payroll\ndeduction, not to exceed one year in length, in writing on a form provided by University Human\nResources - Employee & Labor Relations.\nAn employee may request other arrangements, and if approved, the schedule of repayment will\nbe established by written agreement between the employee and the Vice President for Human\nResources (or designee). (In the case of Senior Research Associates, Research Associates and\nall levels of Librarians, such other arrangements shall be between the employee and the\nProvost's Office.)\n7. Grievance\nInvoluntary termination due to layoff is subject to Guide Memo 2.1.11: Staff Grievance Policy\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/staff-\ngrievance-policy). Only the decision to select the particular employee for layoff can be grieved.\nFootnote(s):\n1 When used in this Guide Memo, continuous university employment is the period of employment\nbeginning with the employee's most recent hire date as a regular staff employee. Reinstatement\nof hire date after a break in service is described in Section 2.d of Guide Memo 2.1.2: Recruiting\n& Hiring of Regular Staff (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-\nemployment-policies/recruiting-and-hiring-regular-staff).\n2 Base pay means the monthly salary of record and does not include any premium pay (e.g., shift\ndifferential, pay for overtime, or supplemental pay). Severance payment is calculated on the\nbase monthly pay at the time of separation or the average base monthly pay earned over the\npreceding 12 months, whichever is greater.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/layoffs",

    "text": "2.1.18 Military Leave\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Human Resources.\nLast Updated\nFebruary 9, 2022\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 22.17\nThe Uniformed Service Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (\"USERRA\")\nprohibits employers from discriminating against employees who fulfill non-career military\nobligations in the Uniformed Services. It also requires employers to provide a leave of absence\nto allow employees to perform military obligations. Separately, the Family Medical Leave Act\n(\"FMLA\") and California Family Rights Act (\"CFRA\") entitles eligible employees to take leave for\na \"qualifying exigency\" when a covered family member is called to active duty and FLMA entitles\neligible employees to take leave to care for a covered family member who is injured in the line of\nduty.\nThis policy provides military leaves as required by these and other laws and complies with the\nother relevant provisions of USERRA, other related regulations or as approved by Stanford\nUniversity.\nApplicability:\nApplies to all regular staff as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/definitions): Definitions, Academic Staff-Research, and Academic Staff-Libraries. For\npolicies that apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, refer to the\nagreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/hr-\nprocesses-policies/labor-relations-collective-bargaining). \n1. Military Training Leave\na. When required to perform annual military training duty, a regular employee receives time off\nfor the period of actual training, up to 17 calendar days a year. The University supplements\nthe employee's military base pay for the scheduled working days of absence, up to the\nemployee's full salary. Employees must complete one year of employment to receive\nsupplemental military training pay from the University. Contact your local Human\nResources Office for more information if needed.\nb. Procedures for Military Training Pay - The affected employee should be placed on Leave\nof Absence Unpaid for reason of Military Service so health and life benefits are not\ninterrupted. Upon conclusion of the training leave, the employee must provide a copy of the\npay stub verifying income received from the military. The department then adjusts the\nemployee's pay for the leave period so that the adjusted salary plus military pay equal the\nusual full salary.\n2. Military Active Service Leave\nAn employee who voluntarily enters military service or is called to active duty for an extended\nperiod will have reinstatement rights to their current position if these requirements are met:\nThe employee ensures Stanford receives advance written or verbal notice of military\nservice,\nThe period of service does not exceed five years,\nThe employee returns to work or applies for reemployment in a timely manner after service\nends, and\nThe employee separates from military service under honorable conditions.\nContact your local Human Resources office with any questions about this information.\n3. Military Spousal Leave\na. Type of Leave\nUnder California law, up to 10 days of unpaid leave is available to eligible employees who are\nspouses/domestic partners of deployed members of the military when the military\nspouse/domestic partner is on leave from deployment during a time of military conflict.\nb. Eligibility\nTo be eligible for this form of leave, an employee must work an average of 20 or more hours per\nweek and be the spouse or domestic partner of a \"qualified member\" of the United States Armed\nForces, National Guard, or Reserves. A \"qualified member\" is a member of the United States\nArmed Forces who has been deployed during a period of military conflict. The employee also\nmust provide: \nnotice of intention to take family military leave within two business days of receiving official\nnotice that the employee's military spouse will be on leave from deployment, and\ndocumentation certifying the employee's military spouse will be on leave from deployment\nduring the time that the employee requests leave.\n4. Qualifying Exigency (Emergency) Leave for Families for\nMembers of the Armed Forces (FMLA/CFRA)\na. Type of Leave\nQualifying emergency leave allows eligible employees (see 4.b) to use some or all of their 12-\nweek FMLA/CFRA leave entitlement for an emergency due to a family member's active duty or\ncall to active duty in any branch of the U.S. Armed Forces. Armed Forces include National Guard\nand Reserves. Qualifying emergencies are defined by regulation and include issues arising from\na short-notice deployment, military events, child care, school activities, financial or legal\narrangements, counseling, rest and recuperation, post-deployment activities, or any issue the\nUniversity and employee agree to designate as a qualifying emergency.\nb.  Eligibility\n1. Employee must be a spouse, domestic partner, child or parent (includes “parent-in-law”\nunder CFRA) of the service member.\n2. Employees are eligible to take this type of leave if employed by the University at least one\nyear and have worked at least 1,250 hours (paid time off, paid leave and unpaid leave not\nincluded) during the 12 months before the start of the requested leave.\n5. Military Caregiver Leave for Families for Members of the\nArmed Forces (FMLA)\na. Type of Leave\nMilitary caregiver leave allows eligible employees (see 4.b) up to 26 weeks of job-protected\nFMLA leave in a rolling 12-month period that begins on the verified FMLA start date to care for a\ncovered family member who is a member of the Armed Forces and who:\nsuffers serious injury or illness in the line of duty, or\nundergoes medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a serious injury or illness.\nService member means veterans and current members of the U.S. Armed Forces including the\nNational Guard or Reserves.\nEligible employees may request caregiver leave to care for a veteran who:\nis undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a qualifying serious injury or\nillness incurred in the line of duty, while on active duty. (A serious illness or injury can\ninclude a preexisting injury or illness that was aggravated in the line of duty, while on active\nduty.), and\nwas a member of the Armed Forces (including the National Guard or Reserves) at some\npoint during the five-year period before undergoing the treatment, recuperation, or therapy.\nb. Eligibility\n1. Employee must be a spouse, parent, son, daughter, or next of kin of the service member.\n2. Employees are eligible to take this type of leave if employed by the University at least one\nyear and have worked at least 1,250 hours (paid time off, paid leave and unpaid leave not\nincluded) during the 12 months before the start of the requested leave.\nNOTE: This leave entitlement does not increase the amount of time an employee can be off work\nfor FMLA/CFRA reasons, except that up to 26 weeks of unpaid leave is available to care for an\ninjured service member during a 12-month period.\nFor example, if an employee has used 12 weeks of FMLA/CFRA leave for the birth of a child, the\nemployee is not entitled to an additional 12 weeks of leave within that 12-month period to deal\nwith exigent circumstances arising from a family member's call to active duty. But, the employee\nwould be entitled to up to another 12 weeks (for a total of 26 weeks combined) to care for a\ncovered family member who is injured in the line of duty.\n6. Benefits during Military Leave\na. Health and Life Benefits\nEmployees on unpaid leave for Military Service (MIL) will have the same University benefit\ncontributions as when actively employed. The employee will be billed for the employee portion of\nthe costs on an after-tax basis on the 7th and 22nd of each month.\nb.

The policy is designed to give maximum flexibility to schools,\ndepartments and other organizational units while assuring compliance with federal and state\nregulations. The provisions of this policy apply only when an offer of employment is made.\nAllowances during the recruitment process are at the discretion of the vice president or vice\nprovost for the area making the hiring decision (see Guide Memo 5.4.2\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/business-and-travel-\nexpenses/business-and-travel-expenses): Business and Travel Expenses, section 13).\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to new and current Stanford faculty and staff except those covered by\ncollective bargaining agreements. For policies that apply to employees covered by collective\nbargaining agreements, refer to the agreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/hr-processes-policies/labor-relations-collective-bargaining). \nWhile policy statements are applicable to the entire University, including SLAC, some of the\ninterpretations of policy contained in this Guide Memo may be different at SLAC. Employees\nshould contact the SLAC Travel Office for guidance regarding relocation policy interpretation at\nSLAC.\n1. Tax Implications\na. Reimbursement Reported as Additional Income\nWhen applying this relocation policy, departments should be aware that the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) requires the University to report any payments, reimbursements, and advances\nassociated with the move of the employee, the employee’s immediate family, and their household\ngoods and personal effects as additional compensation income to the employee, subject to\npayroll taxes.\n2. General Policies\na.

Stanford Employees\nEmployees eligible for taxable moving reimbursements and advances per IRS guidelines (see\nsection 1) include:\nNew full-time employees whose new Stanford job location is at least 50 miles farther from\ntheir former home than their old job location was from their former home.\nCurrent full-time employees temporarily reassigned to a location 50 or more miles away. If\nsuch a reassignment is for less than a year, it is a Stanford business expense and not tax-\nreportable. Travel rules apply; see Guide Memo 5.4.2\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/business-and-travel-\nexpenses/business-and-travel-expenses): Business and Travel Expenses. However, if\nrelocation is for a year or more, relocation rules apply, as covered in this Guide Memo.\nExceptions to the eligibility criteria may be made by the appropriate vice president, vice provost,\ndean or designee.\nTax Note: Exceptions that do not meet IRS guidelines (for example: full-time employment or 50-\nmile distance) are tax-reportable to the employee.\nb.

The cars may be driven or shipped.\n10. Expenses for Return Trips to Former Residence\na. Policy\nIn a case where a new employee must return to their former residence to help with a move, or\nwhere the new employee is separated from their family for more than one month, the cognizant\nofficer may authorize reimbursement for expenses relating to up to two trips to the employee's\nformer residence.\nb. Procedure\nAny reimbursement should cover transportation costs only and should be confirmed in writing\nbefore the travel takes place. Receipts are required (see Guide Memo 5.4.2\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/business-and-travel-\nexpenses/business-and-travel-expenses): Business and Travel Expenses.)\nTax Note: All expenses for return trips are tax reportable.\n11. Limited Assignment Expenses\na. Policy\nThe payment of expenses by the University may be authorized for faculty and regular staff with\nspecifically limited assignments and for non-employees and distinguished visitors who perform\nteaching, research, or other related services. Limited assignments are for one calendar year or\nless and presuppose no change in permanent residence nor primary affiliation with another\norganization. All travel expense policies of the University (Guide Memo 5.4.2\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/business-and-travel-\nexpenses/business-and-travel-expenses): Business and Travel Expenses) apply to limited\nassignments, with these points of clarification:\nb. Expenses are reimbursable\nonly to the extent authorized in a formal letter of authorization (invitation). Transportation\nexpenses for dependents may be allowed at the discretion of the vice president, vice provost,\ndean or designee, but will not be allowed for an assignment of fewer than 30 days.\nTax Note: Limited assignment expenses are tax reportable unless these conditions occur:\nThe person on limited assignment has duplicate expenses (both the home residence and\nthe limited assignment lodging).\nA member of the person's family continues to live in the home residence.\nThe person retains a primary affiliation to the home institution (i.e., to Stanford for\nemployees on limited assignment elsewhere, to their other employer for visitors to\nStanford).Tax Note: Dependent expenses for a person on limited assignment are tax\nreportable.\nc. Local transportation costs\nshould be held to a minimum by the use of University vehicles and public transportation, but car\nrentals and taxi expenses are reimbursable when necessary and reasonable, to the extent\nauthorized in the letter of authorization.\nd.

Any income from renting the primary residence while on temporary assignment must\nbe considered in the lodging reimbursement calculation.\n12. Reassignment Expenses\nIf reassignment of a faculty or staff member for official University purposes requires relocation,\nthe University may pay the actual, reasonable, and necessary costs incurred, as approved by the\ncognizant vice president, vice provost, dean, or designee, subject to a maximum agreed upon in\nwriting in advance. Expense incurred in connection with sabbaticals (unless retained on salary by\nStanford) and leaves of absence will not be reimbursed.\n13. Expense Advances\nWhere appropriate, the U",

Expense Advances\nWhere appropriate, the University may elect to advance a relocating employee an amount to\ncover anticipated expenditures. Such advances may cover only expenses reimbursable to the\nemployee and must be made in accordance with Guide Memo 5.4.1\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/travel-and-business-\nexpenses/expense-advances), Expense Advances.\n14. Repayment Provisions\nFaculty or staff members who receive relocation assistance to accept a Stanford position will be\nrequired to reimburse the University for relocation assistance if they voluntarily leave the\nUniversity for any reason within 12 months from their date of hire. Reimbursement to the\nUniversity will be pro-rated according to the number of months the employee has worked at\nStanford. (For example, an employee who leaves after six months would be required to repay\nhalf the relocation allowance paid.) This repayment provision must be included in the offer letter.\nTax Note: Non-repayment of relocation allowances has tax implications.\n15. Reimbursement Procedures\na. Oracle Financials Reimbursement Request\nTo claim reimbursement for relocation expenses the individual should submit an online Expense\nReport the through the Oracle Financials Expense Requests system. For requirements on\nreceipts and other documentation, see Guide Memo 5.4.2\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/business-and-travel-\nexpenses/business-and-travel-expenses), Business and Travel Expenses, section 14.\nb. Accounting\nRelocation expenses are coded to moving expense expenditure types. Most such costs are\nclassified as allowable. However, if the employee voluntarily resigns within 12 months of hire, the\nnet moving costs (that is, the portion not repaid) must be transferred to an unallowable moving\nexpense expenditure type.\nc. Tax Withholding\nFor reimbursements on which income tax and Social Security withholding are required at the\ntime of payment, Travel and Reimbursement will arrange with the Payroll Office for payment to\nbe made through the payroll process.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/relocation-faculty-and-staff",

For procedures specific to SLAC, contact SLAC's Human Resources\nDepartment.\nHospital—\"Hospital\" refers to both Stanford Health Care (SHC) and Lucile Packard\nChildren's Hospital (LPCH). The hospitals are separate employers, each with its own\npolicies and procedures. For more information, contact SHC or LPCH Human Resources.\nPurpose:\nTo provide policies and guidance that support recruiting and hiring a diverse and talented\nworkforce. To accomplish this, Stanford strongly encourages hiring supervisors to develop\nthe broadest possible applicant pool allowing the best and the brightest candidates—\ninternal and external—to fairly compete for all open positions. Through fair and open\ncompetition and the application of equitable evaluation criteria, Stanford hires the best\navailable candidates.\nTo meet University policies and practices and comply with federal and state regulations.\n1. General Recruiting and Hiring Responsibilities\na. University Human Resources\nUniversity Human Resources is responsible for developing, monitoring, and overseeing\nemployment policies and providing the University with support services necessary to attain\nstaffing objectives.\nb. Local Human Resources Manager\nThe local Human Resources Manager is the person responsible for administering recruiting and\nhiring policies for each organization.\nc. Hiring Supervisors\nHiring supervisors are those faculty and staff designated to make staff hiring decisions. Hiring\nsupervisors are responsible for making such decisions in accordance with the policies and\nprocedures established by the University and set forth in this Guide Memo. Each hiring\nsupervisor is accountable for their actions in matters relating to applicable sections of this policy,\ncompliance with federal and state regulations governing employment, and performance in\nachieving affirmative action program goals. Questions on these policies that cannot be resolved\nat the local level should be referred to the Vice President for Human Resources.\nGuide to Supervisors\nTypical Responsibilities for University Human Resources\nConducts full-service recruiting and recruitment programs\nDevelops recruitment and hiring-related programs\nConsults on recruitment strategies, compliance, selection and on-boarding\nAdministers online recruiting systems and websites\nEnsures regulatory compliance; administers recruiting and hiring policies\nOversees contingent staffing, international hiring, background checks, third-party\nmanagement (including executive search firms)\nTypical Responsibilities for Local Human Resources Managers\nRepresents needs of the unit to University HR\nDevelops programs to support local recruiting needs\nFacilitates and provides consultation on the recruiting process within the local unit and\nbetween the local unit and University HR\nConducts and coordinates position searches, including selection and use of employment\nsearch firms\nImplements and administers recruitment and hiring policies\nTypical Responsibilities for Hiring Supervisors\nMakes selection and hiring decisions within the stipulated policies and parameters,\nincluding reviewing resumes, interviewing candidates, conducting reference checks, and\ndocumenting processes and decisions\nImplements recruiting and staffing policies, programs and processes locally\n2. Recruiting and Hiring Policies\na. Equal Employment Opportunity & Affirmative Action\nIn accordance with all applicable law, it is the policy of the University to:\nComply with all affirmative action requirements, and\nProvide equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees.\nGuide to Supervisors\nAll employees in a position to make hiring decisions (“hiring supervisors”) are expected to comply\nwith the “Equal Employment Opportunity Statement” distributed annually by the University’s\nDiversity & Access Office and 1.7.4 Equal Employment Opportunity, Non-Discrimination, and\nAffirmative Action Policy (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-\nprinciples/harassment-discrimination/equal-employment-opportunity-non)' provision on “Equal\nEmployment Opportunity and Affirmative Action Policy.”\nThe University complies with Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 and its regulations.\nThe Title IX Compliance Officer is the Director of the Diversity & Access Office. If an employee\nbelieves the University is not in compliance with Title IX and its regulations, they can contact the\nTitle IX Coordinator at Kingscote Gardens (2nd Floor), 419 Lagunita Drive, Stanford, CA 94305-\n8231, or, call (650) 723-0755 [TTY at (650) 723-1216] or email equalopportunity@stanford.edu\n(mailto:equalopportunity@stanford.edu).\nb. Employment Rights and Preferences of Former and Current Regular Staff\nThe University gives current and former regular staff certain reemployment rights and\npreferences described below:\n(1) Right to Reemployment or Return to Active Employment\n(a) Definition\nThe right of a former regular staff to reemployment or return to active employment in their former\nUniversity position to the extent required by law.\n(b) Who Qualifies\nReemployment rights extend to former regular staff who:\nTerminated employment to serve in the military. A department that receives an inquiry about\nthe reemployment of a former employee returning from the Armed Services should consult\nwith an Employee Relations Representative.\nReturns from a leave of absence on or before the agreed-upon return date (e.g., military,\nchildbirth, family, medical) when the leave was formally requested and granted in\naccordance with University policy.\n(2) Hiring Preference\nThe University is committed to hiring the best-qualified candidate for the job. When the\nqualifications stated in the job listing and predetermined job-related selection criteria are used to\ndetermine each candidate's qualifications, and more than one qualified candidate competes for a\njob, the employment offer must be extended first to the candidate who has preference according\nto 2.b.3 below.\n(3) Order of preference\nFollow this order when considering substantially equal candidates:\n(a) First Preference:\nRegular staff who have been given written notice of permanent layoff or who are permanently\nlaid off under the policies in Guide Memo 2.1.17: Layoffs.\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/layoffs)This employment preference continues for 12 consecutive months following the\ndate of layoff. Layoff preference also applies to regular staff whose positions are being eliminated\nand who have been informed that they will be laid off if they do not obtain alternative employment\nin the same department/administrative unit.\n(b) Second Preference:\nCurrent regular staff who meet the qualifications for the position and for whom placement in this\njob would constitute a promotion, or who have successfully completed a formal training program\nfor the specific job.\n(c) Third Preference:\nCurrent temporary or casual employees on the Stanford payroll applying for a position in the\nsame workgroup reporting to the same supervisor where the employee currently works in a\ntemporary or casual role.\nc.

Employment of Related Persons\nEmployment by a related person in any position (e.g., regular staff, faculty, other teaching,\ntemporary, casual, third party, etc.) within an organizational unit can occur only with the approval\nof the responsible Vice Provost, Vice President (or similar level equivalent to the highest\nadministrative person within the organizational unit), or their designee. Under no circumstances\nmay a supervisor hire or approve any compensation action for any employee to whom the\nsupervisor is related. An individual may not supervise, evaluate the job performance, or approve\ncompensation for any individual with whom the supervisor is related.\nEven when the criteria discussed here are met, the employment of a related person in any\nposition within the organization must have the approval of the local human resources office, in\naddition to the approval of the hiring manager's supervisor, including faculty supervisors. \nGuide to Supervisors\nEmployment by a related person in any position (e.g., regular staff, faculty, other teaching,\ntemporary, casual, third party, etc.) within an organizational unit can result in an actual or\nperceived conflict of interest and is strongly discouraged.\nThe university recognizes that relationships may develop in the workplace. The university\nexpects its employees to disclose relationships as appropriate, specifically in the case of direct\nreporting relationships and/or potential conflict of interest situations. Failure to properly disclose a\nrelationship or family connection may lead to corrective action measures being taken.\nAll the above requirements also apply to employing and hiring those with consensual sexual or\nromantic relationships. In addition, consensual sexual or romantic relationships must also be\ndisclosed in compliance with section 4 in Guide Memo 1.7.2: Consensual Sexual or Romantic\nRelationships In the Workplace and Educational Setting\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/harassment-\ndiscrimination/consensual-sexual-or-romantic).\nDefinition of Related Person - The employee’s spouse; same-sex domestic partner; children of\nthe employee, spouse or same-sex domestic partner; parents and parents-in-law; parent\nsurrogate; brothers and sisters of the employee; grandparents and grandchildren of the\nemployee; and, any other dependent family member who lived in the employee’s residence.\nd. Rehiring Former Regular Staff\nRegardless of the reason for rehire, all former staff including those who meet the reinstatement\ncriteria set forth below, must serve a new trial period.\n(1) Reinstating the Hire Date:\nFormer regular staff will have their hire date reinstated if they left the University in good standing\nand meet these timelines:\na. Former regular staff who have been laid off and are reemployed by the University within 24\nmonths following the date of layoff will have the most recent hire date prior to layoff\nreinstated.\nb. Former regular staff whose employment was terminated for reasons other than layoff will\nhave the most recent date of hire prior to termination reinstated if reemployment occurs\nwithin 12 months following the date of termination. Reinstatement includes all the following:\nBridging of service by restoring the most recent hire date in a benefits-eligible position\nbefore termination,\nRestoration of any sick leave balance at the time of termination, and\nVacation accrual rate based on the reinstated hire date.\n(2) Rehire After Involuntary Discharge\nIf a regular staff member was terminated from the University for cause, supervisors must consult\ntheir local HR Office and Employee Relations Representative before rehire or reinstatement. An\nindividual who was terminated for gross misconduct is not eligible for rehire.\nGuide to Supervisors\nFor information on how rehire or reinstatement affects benefits, visit the Cardinal at Work website\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/health/change-your-benefits/employment-\nchanges) or contact the University HR Service Team\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/contact-us?utm_source=benefits-\nrewards&utm_medium=nav-link&utm_campaign=Contact).\nHiring Hospital Employees - See Guide Memo 2.1.4: Hiring Employees from Stanford Health\nCare or its Predecessor Companies (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-\nresources/staff-employment-policies/hiring-employees-stanford-health-care-or-its) for information\non the applicability of University employment policies and eligibility for University benefits when\nhiring regular staff who was previously employed by Stanford Health Care (or its predecessor\ncompanies) or Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital.\ne. Driving-Related Job Requirements\nA driver’s license requirement may not be included in a job description or job posting unless the\nfollowing two conditions are satisfied: \n1. The hiring department reasonably expects driving to be one of the job functions of the\nposition; and\n2. The hiring department reasonably believes that satisfying the job functions of the position\nwould not be comparable in travel time or cost to the department by using an alternative\nform of transportation (an “alternative form of transportation” may include, but is not limited\nto, walking, bicycling, carpooling, taxi, or using a ride-hailing service).\nf. Age as a Hiring Factor\nAge (except for persons under 18 who have not graduated from high school) may not be used as\na factor in hiring unless it can be shown as a necessary job qualification.\ng. Employment of Minors\nBefore an offer of employment is made, the hiring department must obtain a work permit for\napplicants under the age of 18 years who have not graduated from high school. A permit is\nobtained from the applicant's school district and is retained in the department file.\nGuide to Supervisors\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and California law restrict the hours and conditions of\nemployment for minors. Because restrictions on the employment of minors can be complex,\nsupervisors should consult with their local Human Resources Office about specific cases.\nGeneral restrictions include:\nExcept as part of approved University programs (e.g., Take Our Children to Work Day),\nminors are not permitted to visit in areas where they would not be permitted to work as\nemployees.\nMinors ages 16-17: In addition to the above, prohibited from working hazardous jobs. No\nother restrictions.\nMinors ages 14-15: In addition to all the above, during school sessions, they cannot work\nmore than 3 hours/day, 18 hours/week. During school vacations, they cannot work more\nthan 8 hours/day, 40 hours/week.\nMinors under age 14: In addition to all the above, prohibited from most non-agricultural\nwork.\n3. Policies and Practices—Search Phase\na. Job Descriptions\nBefore a job description is entered into the HR Applicant Tracking system:\n(1) Hiring supervisor's responsibilities:\nIdentify the functions of the job, define and describe the duties and responsibilities of the\nposition, including required regulatory training, develop and document objective criteria for the\nselection process, and obtain the local Human Resources Office's confirmation of position level\nand salary range. For guidance, visit Staff Compensation\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/compensation/staff) on the Cardinal at\nWork website. Qualifications cannot unnecessarily prevent or lessen the employment\nopportunities for any class of applicants or potential applicants, as identified in Section 2.b.\n(2) Local Human Resources Office's responsibilities:\nReviews the Position Summary for clarity and content, classification, certificate and license\nrequirements, and salary range, and ensures that the job description is entered into the HR\nApplicant Tracking system.

The job requisition is also reviewed for appropriateness of posting. All\njob postings must include the pay range for the position. For guidance, visit the Getting Started &\nJob Descriptions section (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/manager-toolkit/attract/getting-\nstarted-job-descriptions) of the Manager Toolkit website.\nGuide to Supervisors\nSelection Criteria - Use the job description and other relevant criteria established by the hiring\nsupervisor (including education, experience, essential skills, abilities, and competencies) to\nscreen applicants and aid in the selection process.\nb. Announcing Job Openings\n(1) Local Human Resources Offices\nAll regular staff vacancies must be listed with the appropriate Human Resources office.\nFor SLAC, SLAC Human Resources Department.\nFor campus, University Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy\nannounces all openings on Stanford Careers (http://stanfordcareers.stanford.edu/) and may\nuse other media as appropriate.\n(2) Temporary Employment\nNon-regular staff vacancies that do not lend themselves to employment of Stanford students due\nto the nature of the work and work schedule, may be listed with commercial temporary\nemployment services and/or Cardinal Temps.\n(3) Text of Advertisements\nAdvertising and other notification of vacancies must be non-discriminatory and must include\nreference to the University's commitment to affirmative action and equal opportunity: “Stanford is\nan equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. All qualified applicants will receive\nconsideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation,\ngender identity, national origin, disability, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic\nprotected by law.”\nc. Posting Period\n(1) Definition\nA posting period is a period during which information about the job opening is made available\nand applications are accepted. Generally, postings should not exceed six months except where\nthe hiring supervisor is actively seeking and reviewing applications for the position.\n(2) Length of Posting Period\nAll vacant positions except those filled through an approved posting period waiver (see Section\n3.d for information on waivers) are posted online for a minimum of 10 calendar days. The posting\nperiod begins when the approved online requisition updates the Applicant Tracking system.\nApplications are accepted through the full posting period. If a job code changes on a posted\nvacant position, it must be reposted online for a minimum of 10 additional calendar days. \n(3) Changes in Posting Period\nPosting periods may not be shortened or eliminated except through the waiver process (see\nSection 3.d). Posting periods may be extended at the hiring supervisor's discretion and\napplications may be accepted beyond the posting period at the supervisor's discretion.\n(4) Timing of Employment Offer\nOffers of employment may not be made until after the expiration of the posting period or an\napproved waiver of posting (see Section 3.d).\nd. Waiver of Posting\nAll regular staff vacancies not posted for the minimum posting period must have an approved\nwaiver of posting before an employment offer can be made. Waiver requests are reviewed and\napproved by University Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy.\n(1) Approval Criteria\nThe hiring department must document the reason for requesting the waiver. The local Human\nResources office must submit the waiver request to University Human Resources: Talent\nManagement & Workforce Strategy. University Human Resources: Talent Management &\nWorkforce Strategy may approve the waiver request if it meets at least one of the following\ncriteria:\nThe department documents critical operational need, or\nThere is a uniquely qualified/skilled applicant and it is unlikely a better-qualified candidate\nwould apply, or\nThe department is reusing a recent (within the past six months) applicant pool for a\ncomparable job likely to result in a similar pool.\n(2) Denial Criteria\nUniversity Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy may deny a waiver\nrequest if it is determined that the requested action would be inconsistent with the University’s\nwaiver or affirmative action policies.\ne. Recruitment of Applicants\n(1) Definition of an Applicant\nCurrently Stanford requires resumes for regular staff positions to be submitted through the\nStanford Careers (or Jobs@SLAC (mailto:Jobs@SLAC)) website. Consistent with this\nrequirement, an applicant is defined as any person who meets all these criteria:\na. The individual submits a resume for a specific position through the Stanford Careers (or\nJobs@SLAC (mailto:Jobs@SLAC)) website,\nb. Stanford considers the individual for employment in a particular position,\nc. The individual's resume indicates the individual possesses the basic qualifications for the\nposition, and\nd. The individual at no time during the selection process prior to receiving an offer of\nemployment removes themselves from further consideration or otherwise indicates that\nthey are no longer interested in the position.\n(2) Equal Opportunity Policy\nWith the assistance of University Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy\nand the local Human Resources Office, departments must make every effort to recruit qualified\nindividuals for job openings, keeping in mind the university's commitment to equal opportunity\nand affirmative action.\n(3) International Recruitment\nPlease review Section 6, International Hiring, before recruiting or hiring outside of the United\nStates.\n(4) Search Firms\nIn general, Stanford makes limited use of the services of executive search firms or employment\nagencies. In the instances where it is necessary to use such services (e.g., senior-level\nvacancies), departments must consult with the local Human Resources Office before making any\narrangement with an outside firm or agency.\nGuide to Supervisors\nThe hiring supervisor is accountable for assuring that the firm or agency is fully informed\nregarding its responsibility for meeting the University’s institutional affirmative action and record\nkeeping responsibilities. Consultation on search firms is available from University Human\nResources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy.\nFor a checklist on how to choose a search firm that meets Stanford’s requirements to provide a\nwidely diverse selection of applicants and the ability to track the applicant pool, go to the\nCardinal at Work website (http://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/manager-toolkit/attract/talent-\nacquisition).\nReceiving Electronic Resumes—Electronic resumes are submitted to University Human\nResources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy using Stanford Careers\n(http://stanfordcareers.stanford.edu/). University Human Resources: Talent Management &\nWorkforce Strategy will send applications a written acknowledgment that their resume has been\nreceived. Electronic resumes are submitted to SLAC using Careers at SLAC\n(http://www6.slac.stanford.edu/general/careers.aspx).  \n4. Policies and Practices—Selection Phase\na. Employment Application Form\n All interviewed applicants must complete and sign a Stanford University application form\n(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ufHovjdzqhKLlD_aA8h0ZCI20k9j9nTS/view?\nusp=share_link).\nStanford does not accept incomplete application forms.\nRetain a copy of all application forms with the appropriate search documentation.\nThe successful candidate’s application form must be retained in the personnel file (see\nGuide Memo 2.1.3: Personnel Files and Data\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/personnel-files-and-data)).\nb.

Interviews\n(1) Standard Administration\nHiring supervisors must ensure standard administration of the interview process, including the\nequivalent treatment of candidates, avoidance of discriminatory questions, and uniform interview\ncontent.\n(2) Accommodation\nAt the request of a disabled candidate, accommodation during the interview process may be\nrequired.\nd. Testing\n(1) Prior Approval\nAll testing or screening devices used in the employment process must be approved by the AVP,\nRecruitment & Talent Management in consultation with the Diversity & Access Office, as\nappropriate. Only standardized, validated test instruments may be considered.\n(2) Accommodations\nAt the request of a disabled applicant, accommodation to enable testing may be required.\n(3) Applicability of Test\nWhen used, approved tests must directly relate to essential job functions and be given to all\napplicants or finalists under the same or equivalent conditions. The test must be scored,\nevaluated, and used as a selection factor equally for all applicants or finalists and maintained\nwith other applications and selection materials.\ne. Reference Checks\nThe hiring supervisor is required to obtain a minimum of two reference checks from previous\nemployers, at least one of which is a current or prior supervisor. If the finalist is a current or\nformer University employee, the hiring supervisor should also contact the current or former\ndepartment (e.g., supervisor and/or Human Resources Manager). Reference checks must be\npart of the candidate’s evaluation and may be used as a factor in the hiring decision if the\ninformation is job-related. No offer of employment can be made before completing the hiring\nprocess, including reference checks.\nGuide to Supervisors\nThe hiring supervisor must exercise caution to ensure that:\nThe names of those contacted for references are retained in the search documentation with\nany unsolicited written references provided by the candidate,\nInconsistent or negative information obtained in a reference check is corroborated, if\npossible, before it is used in making a hiring decision, and\nReference information used in the hiring decision is job-related and can be shown to be a\npredictor of job performance.\nLocal Human Resources Offices may provide consultation.\nf. False and/or Misleading Statements\nWithdraw from consideration any applicant found to have misleading and/or false statements on\nthe employment application or other documents.\ng. Review of Personnel Files\nHiring supervisors have access to personnel files of current and former University employees\nwho are finalists for the position. No offer of employment can be made before the hiring\nsupervisor or Human Resources reviews the personnel files.\nGuide to Supervisors\nFor details and assistance, contact the local Human Resources Office (see Guide Memo 2.1.3:\nPersonnel Files and Data (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-\nemployment-policies/personnel-files-and-data)).\n5. Hiring Decisions, Offers and Documentation\na. Hiring Decisions\nHiring decisions for regular University staff positions are based on the relative job-related\nqualifications of the applicants for the positions, with full consideration of the employment rights\nand preferences specified in Section 2.b.\n1. The hiring supervisor is responsible for judging the relative qualifications of each applicant\nand for making the hiring decision, consistent with University policy and applicable\ngovernmental laws and regulations.\n2. The local Human Resources Office is responsible for reviewing proposed hiring decisions\nand for ensuring compliance with regulations, laws, and/or University employment policies.\n3. The Diversity & Access Office, if notified by an applicant or administrator regarding a\nparticular opening, may delay a proposed hiring action for further review if it appears\ninconsistent with the University's Affirmative Action Program.\nb. Employment Offers\n(1) Timing of Offer\nEmployment offers should be made after:\nThe expiration of the posting period (or, after approval of a waiver request), and\nThe employment action (including in-hire salary) has received all required approvals.\n(2) Conditional Offer of Employment\nThe hiring department must issue a written conditional offer of employment to the successful\ncandidate using an approved offer letter template. Approved templates include those for standard\nhires, promotions, and out-of-country hires. If a background check is required by policy, the\nwritten conditional offer of employment will inform the candidate that the offer is contingent upon\nsuccessfully completing and passing a background check.\nGuide to Supervisors\nWorkplace Accommodation - At the request of a candidate or applicant who has a disability,\nworkplace accommodation may be needed. The hiring supervisor should refer to Guide Memo\n2.2.7: Requesting Workplace Accommodations for Employees with Disabilities\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/requesting-workplace-accommodations-employees).\nOut-of-Country - If this is an offer of employment for the applicant to work in a primary site\noutside the U.S., Staffing Services will assist the local Human Resources Office with\narrangements. See Section 6 for details on International Hiring.\nc. Background Checks\nStanford policy requires the successful completion of a background check before the first day of\nemployment. Additional background checks may be required in some job classifications (e.g.,\nDeputy Sheriffs). A background check can only be initiated after a written conditional offer of\nemployment is made to the candidate. Local Human Resources Offices will provide information\non specific requirements.\nd. Criminal Records\nA criminal record will not automatically disqualify a candidate from employment with the\nuniversity. University Human Resources/Employee & Labor Relations will conduct an\nindividualized assessment of any criminal record revealed during the background check process.\nIf individual circumstances warrant, a candidate with a criminal record may be disqualified from\nemployment.\ne. Documentation and Record Keeping\n(1) Pre-Employment\nNew, transferred, rehired, or promoted employees may not start work in the new position until all\nappropriate forms have been signed and processed.\n(2) Non-Selected Applicants\nThe hiring supervisor is responsible for oral or written notification to all non-selected\napplicants who were interviewed.\nThe hiring supervisor must ensure that all search summary records are completed,\nincluding an indication of all applicants' status (disposition data) in the HR Applicant\nTracking system. For more information, see the Cardinal at Work website\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/manager-toolkit/attract/talent-acquisition).\n(3) Completeness\nRecords must include the resume and application materials of all applicants for a position, as\nwell as documents pertaining to individuals considered for the position.\n(4) Patent and Copyright Agreement\nAll employees must complete a Patent and Copyright Agreement Form (SU18) as a condition of\nemployment.\n(5) Retention Time\nThe hiring department must retain records relating to a search, selection, and employment\ndecision for a minimum of four years following the decision. Should there be a dispute\n(grievance/litigation), the documents must be retained until the matter is resolved, if not resolved\nby the conclusion of the four-year period.\n(6) More Information\nFor more information, see the Cardinal at Work website\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/manager-toolkit/attract/talent-acquisition).\n6.

Flexible work encompasses a broad\nspectrum of approaches, including Hybrid work arrangements where staff may work from home,\nalthough their primary work location continues to be at Stanford. This guide memo sets forth\npolicies and procedures to facilitate Hybrid work arrangements for eligible employees in\nappropriate circumstances. For work arrangements where the employee’s primary work location\nis at home or other location, see Guide Memo 2.1.21: Remote Work Arrangements\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/remote-\nwork-arrangements).\nApplicability:\nApplies to all employees, including regular employees, employees represented by SEIU Higher\nEducation Workers Local 2007, Academic Staff-Research, Academic Staff-Libraries, and\ncontingent (casual or temporary) employees as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/definitions).\nThis policy does not apply to:\nEmployees covered by collective bargaining agreements other than SEIU Higher Education\nWorkers Local 2007\nFaculty, Academic Staff-Teaching, Other Teaching Titles, Instructors, or Clinician Educators\nStudent employees\nEmployees who are working remotely outside the U.S. See Guide Memo 11.2.22\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/global-activities/global-human-resources-staff-\nemployment-policies/international-employees).\nEmployees telecommuting temporarily but for an extended period outside the U.S. See\nGuide Memo 11.2.21 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/global-activities/global-\nhuman-resources-staff-employment-policies/global-telecommuting).\n1. Policy Statement/Philosophy\nThe workplace culture at Stanford is one that is rooted in collaboration, continuous discourse\nabout planned work and projects underway, and in providing stellar service to our university\ncommunity. With appropriate use of technology and managerial oversight, staff whose roles allow\nfor work to be performed away from their Primary Stanford Work Location may be eligible for a\nHybrid work arrangement. (“Primary Stanford Work Location” and “Hybrid” are defined below in\nsection 2).\n2. Definitions\na. “Stanford Campus” means the primary campus in Stanford, CA.\nb. “Stanford Satellite Office or Hub” means a Stanford location other than the Stanford\nCampus which allows the university to spread its operations across multiple\nregions/locations. These include Stanford Redwood City (SRWC), SLAC, Stanford\nResearch Park, Hopkins Marine Station, the Newark satellite hub, and other locations.\nc. “Stanford Alternative Worksite” means Stanford-leased premises, outside of the Stanford\nCampus and Stanford Satellite Office or Hub, where individuals can schedule a designated\nwork space at least one day per week. The alternative worksite provides an office\nenvironment with a variety of workspace amenities, free of home distractions.\nd. “Stanford Work Location” includes the Stanford Campus, Stanford Satellite Office or Hub,\nor Stanford Alternative Worksite.\ne. “Primary Stanford Work Location” means the Stanford Campus, Stanford Satellite Office or\nHub, or Stanford Alternative Worksite designated by Stanford as the primary location\navailable to the employee to perform their work.\nf. “Hybrid” means a role that the university determines is suitable to be performed to some\nvarying extent off-site and for which a Stanford employee requests and is approved by\nStanford to work in different work locations (e.g., mix of Primary Stanford Work Location\nand their home or other location). Individuals in a Hybrid work arrangement have a Primary\nStanford Work Location designated by the university. Hybrid roles require a regular\npresence at the employee's Primary Stanford Work Location. Required regular presence is\ndetermined by the employee’s department or unit and is typically two, three, or four days\nper week or an equivalent amount of time monthly. Managers are generally expected to\narrange their in-person work so there is adequate staffing on-site. Managers who believe\ntheir operational needs warrant a regular cadence for hybrid that is less than an average of\ntwo days per week or less than a similar amount of time monthly, should discuss this with\ntheir Dean, Vice Provost, or Vice President (or their delegate) as well as the local senior\nHR Manager to obtain approval.\ng. “Telecommute” or “telecommuting” means performing Stanford work on a regular, part-time\nbasis as part of a Hybrid work arrangement from a location other than the employee’s\nPrimary Stanford Work Location, provided the location is not a Stanford Work Location.\n3. Eligibility\na. Eligibility Criteria\n1. Hybrid work arrangements should only be considered at the employee’s request.\n2. Managers should take into consideration, among other factors, the nature of the work,\noperational needs, whether the department can maintain the quality and effectiveness of\ntheir services to members of the university community, performance and productivity of the\nemployee, attendance and the ability of the employee to work independently. \n3. Generally, managers will determine the specific procedures for evaluating, approving or\ndenying a request for a Hybrid work arrangement in a manner consistent with this policy\nand school/unit guidelines. (For additional information, see Flexible Work\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/working-stanford/flexible-work) on the Cardinal at Work\nwebsite.)\n4. Decisions about the suitability of Hybrid work arrangements are discretionary and typically\nmade by the department in consultation with local HR.\n4. Requirements\na. General Requirements\n1. Employees in a Hybrid work arrangement must comply with all Stanford policies and\nprocedures, including the appropriate handling of confidential information.\n2. At all times, employees in a Hybrid work arrangement will have access to a fully equipped\nworkspace at their Primary Stanford Work Location. Employees in a Hybrid work\narrangement are not required to telecommute. Employees in a Hybrid work arrangement\ncan choose to work at their Primary Stanford Work Location on any regularly scheduled\nday, including on days when they would normally telecommute.\n3. Employees in a Hybrid work arrangement are expected to remain available and accessible\nduring regularly-scheduled and approved work hours, as determined by the department.\nEmployees may be required to attend meetings and functions in person, including on days\nthey would customarily telecommute if in a Hybrid work arrangement.\n4. Hybrid work arrangements for non-exempt employees can only include full workdays on-\nsite or at their telecommuting worksite. Non-exempt employees are required to strictly\nadhere to required rest and meal breaks, and to accurately report their work hours as set\nforth in Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/compensation-staff-employees). Non-exempt employees must obtain prior\napproval before working any overtime.\n5. Employees in a Hybrid work arrangement are expected to make dependent care\narrangements during regularly-scheduled work hours.\n6. For approved Hybrid work arrangements, travel between an employee’s telecommuting\nworksite and their Primary Stanford Work Location is considered part of an employee’s\nnormal commute and associated expenses are not reimbursable. Employees who have\nrequested and been approved to be Hybrid are not entitled to reimbursement for travel to a\nStanford Work Location because the emp",

Employees who have\nrequested and been approved to be Hybrid are not entitled to reimbursement for travel to a\nStanford Work Location because the employee has requested a more flexible work\narrangement even though a workspace at a Stanford Work Location is available on a daily\nbasis.\n7. Employees who are approved to work a Hybrid work arrangement must sign the Hybrid\nWork Agreement, and any other documents the department or university may require. The\nHybrid Work Agreement should be reviewed and renewed by the manager and employee\nperiodically but no less frequently than annually.\n8. HR Managers or their delegates are required to ensure all employees in an approved\nHybrid work arrangement have a Hybrid Work Agreement that complies with this policy and\nis signed by the employee, manager and HR Manager. In addition, HR Managers or their\ndelegates must keep the HR information system up-to-date with the employee’s Primary\nStanford Work Location and the location from which the employee in a Hybrid work\narrangement telecommutes. Such records must also include the frequency of the Hybrid\nwork arrangement. The Hybrid Work Agreement may specify an end date; however,\nwhether an end date is specified, the university reserves the right to modify or discontinue\nthe agreement.\n9. Hybrid work arrangements may be modified on an ongoing basis or discontinued at any\ntime at the university’s sole discretion, or at the request of the employee, with reasonable\nnotice, typically two (2) weeks.\nb. Equipment\n1. Employees approved to telecommute as part of a Hybrid work arrangement are responsible\nto ensure that their telecommuting worksite is ergonomically appropriate. Employees who\ndo not have or are not able to provide themselves an ergonomically appropriate place to\nwork should not telecommute under a Hybrid work arrangement and should work instead at\ntheir Primary Stanford Work Location.\n2. Employees working in approved Hybrid work arrangements are eligible to purchase or be\nreimbursed up to $250 for basic necessary ergonomic equipment for their telecommuting\nworksite only to the extent such equipment is recommended by Environmental Health &\nSafety (EH&S) following an ergonomic assessment. Reimbursement of expenses or the\npurchase of the equipment by the department will occur only after the employee\ncompletes all required steps outlined in the Stanford Ergonomics Program\n(https://ehs.stanford.edu/topic/ergonomics) available on the EH&S website\nat ehs.stanford.edu (http://ehs.stanford.edu/). For additional information regarding basic\nhome office equipment purchasing resources and ergonomic needs, see Home Office\nEquipment and Expense Guidelines (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/working-\nstanford/flexible-work/flexible-work-arrangements-policies#equipment).\n3. Employees who are approved by their department to telecommute as part of a Hybrid work\narrangement are responsible to ensure their telecommuting worksite is equipped with\nadequate internet connectivity to perform their work, including video conferencing. \n4. Since the university provides a fully-equipped Primary Stanford Work Location for\nemployees in Hybrid work arrangements, it generally does not provide reimbursement for\ncell phone or home Internet connectivity unless there is a demonstrated business\nnecessity. Please refer to Guide Memo 8.1.3: Provision of Mobile Equipment and Related\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/services/communication-and-mail-\nservices/provision-mobile-equipment-and-related-services) Services.\n5. Procedure\n1. Employees should discuss their request for a Hybrid work arrangement with their manager.\n2. If the manager believes a Hybrid work arrangement may be suitable, the employee should\ncomplete the Hybrid Work Agreement and send it to their manager for review. (Managers\ncan obtain the agreement through their HR Manager.)\n3. If approved, the employee, manager and HR Manager should sign the Hybrid Work\nAgreement and follow all requirements in this policy.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/hybrid-telecommuting-work-arrangements",

In appropriate circumstances, Stanford\nmay hire or transition existing staff to work in Remote roles in which the individual’s primary\nworkspace is at a location other than a Stanford location. This guide memo sets forth policies\nand procedures to facilitate Remote work arrangements for eligible employees in appropriate\ncircumstances. For work arrangements where the employee’s primary work location is at\nStanford, see Guide Memo 2.1.20: Hybrid (Telecommuting) Work Arrangements\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/hybrid-\ntelecommuting-work-arrangements).\nApplicability: Applies to all employees, including regular employees, employees represented by\nSEIU Higher Education Workers Local 2007, Academic Staff-Research, Academic Staff-Libraries,\nand contingent (casual or temporary) employees as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/definitions).\nThis policy does not apply to:\nEmployees covered by collective bargaining agreements other than SEIU Higher Education\nWorkers Local 2007\nFaculty, Academic Staff-Teaching, Other Teaching Titles, Instructors, or Clinician Educators\nStudent employees\nEmployees who are working remotely outside the U.S. See Guide Memo 11.2.22\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/global-activities/global-human-resources-staff-\nemployment-policies/international-employees).\nEmployees telecommuting temporarily but for an extended period outside the U.S. See\nGuide Memo 11.2.21 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/global-activities/global-\nhuman-resources-staff-employment-policies/global-telecommuting).\n1. Policy Statement/Philosophy\nThe workplace culture at Stanford is one that is rooted in collaboration, continuous discourse\nabout planned work and projects underway, and in providing stellar service to our university\ncommunity. With appropriate use of technology and managerial oversight, staff whose roles allow\nfor all work to be performed at a location that is not a Stanford location may be eligible for a\nRemote work arrangement. (“Remote” is defined below in section 2).\n2. Definitions\na. “Stanford Campus” means the primary campus in Stanford, CA.\nb. “Stanford Satellite Office or Hub” means a Stanford location other than the Stanford\nCampus which allows the university to spread its operations across multiple\nregions/locations. These include Stanford Redwood City (SRWC), SLAC, Stanford\nResearch Park, Hopkins Marine Station, the Newark satellite hub, and other locations.\nc. “Stanford Alternative Worksite” means Stanford-leased premises, outside of the Stanford\nCampus and Stanford Satellite Office or Hub, where individuals can schedule a designated\nwork space at least one day per week. The alternative worksite provides an office\nenvironment with a variety of workspace amenities, free of home distractions.\nd. \"Stanford Work Location\" includes the Stanford Campus, Stanford Satellite Office or Hub,\nor Stanford Alternative Worksite.\ne. “Primary Stanford Work Location” means the Stanford Campus, Stanford Satellite Office or\nHub, or Stanford Alternative Worksite designated by Stanford as the primary location\navailable to the employee to perform their work.\nf. “Remote” means a role in which a Stanford employee is approved or designated by\nStanford to work from home or at a site other than a Stanford Work Location and the\nemployee is not required to have a regular presence on-site to perform their duties as\noutlined under a hybrid work arrangement (defined in Guide Memo 2.1.20: Hybrid\n(Telecommuting) Work Arrangements (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-\nresources/staff-employment-policies/hybrid-telecommuting-work-arrangements)). This also\nincludes an employee who is approved or designated by Stanford to telecommute on a full-\ntime but temporary basis (more than 4 consecutive weeks) from a location other than the\nemployee’s Primary Stanford Work Location or other Stanford Work Location. Although\nRemote employees may be required to come to a Stanford Work Location infrequently or\non limited occasions (e.g., generally no more than a few days total each quarter), this\nwould not change their Remote status.\n3. Eligibility\na. Eligibility Criteria\n1. Some departments may have work conducive to hiring Remote staff. When considering\nwhether a Remote work arrangement is appropriate, managers should take into\nconsideration, among other factors, the nature of the work, costs described in Section 4\nbelow, whether the department can maintain the quality and effectiveness of their services\nto members of the university community with an employee working in a Remote role, and\nwhether the work should or must be performed remotely.\n2. When an existing employee wishes to transition to work remotely, managers should take\ninto consideration applicable factors listed above, performance and productivity of the\nemployee, and the ability of the employee to work independently.\n3. Decisions about the suitability of Remote work arrangements are discretionary and require\napproval from the Dean or Associate Dean, Vice or Associate Vice Provost or Vice or\nAssociate Vice President or designee as well as the local senior HR Manager.\n4. Requirements\na. General Requirements\n1. Employees in a Remote work arrangement must comply with all Stanford policies and\nprocedures, including the appropriate handling of confidential information.\n2. Employees in a Remote work arrangement are expected to remain available and\naccessible during regularly-scheduled and approved work hours, as determined by the\ndepartment. Employees may be required to attend meetings and functions in person.\n3. Non-exempt employees are required to strictly adhere to required rest and meal breaks,\nand to accurately report their work hours as set forth in Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation\nof Staff Employees (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-\nemployment-policies/compensation-staff-employees). Non-exempt employees must obtain\nprior approval before working any overtime.\n4. Employees in a Remote work arrangement are expected to make dependent care\narrangements during regularly-scheduled work hours.\n5. Remote employees are paid competitive rates based on the geographic region where they\nwork. To ensure consistent, equitable application of our compensation program, University\nHuman Resources--Staff Compensation will work in partnership with local HR Managers to\nreview and approve the compensation of all employees in Remote work arrangements,\nincluding newly hired employees, employees transitioning into an approved Remote work\narrangement, and employees who move and change their Remote work location.  The\nuniversity may adjust salary rates for employees who transition into a Remote work\narrangement or who move and change their Remote work location consistent with the\nforegoing. Employees in Remote work arrangements must obtain approval in advance from\nthe department and the local senior HR Manager, and inform Stanford Benefits if they plan\nto move their Remote work location to a different city or state. In addition, the department\nshould review the provisions of Guide Memo 2.2.2: Out-of-State Employees\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/out-state-employees) and Fingate\n(https://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payadmin/admin_outStateEE.html) with\nrespect to out-of-state payroll for Remote employees working in the U.S. but outside of\nCalifornia.\n6.

For Remote employees whose residence is within a 10-county area*, travel to a Stanford\nWork Location will not be reimbursed because the remote arrangement is at the\nemployee’s request and there is space available for the employee to work on campus. For\nother Remote employees, Stanford will reimburse expenses for occasional, required travel\nto a Stanford Work Location as long as the travel is necessarily incurred and the employee\nreceives prior approval by the employee’s department/manager.\n*The 10-county area includes all of the following counties: Santa Clara County, San Mateo\nCounty, San Francisco County, Alameda County, Contra Costa County, Marin County, Napa\nCounty, Sonoma County, Solano County, or Santa Cruz County.\n7. Remote employees must be provided with appropriate reimbursement for required and\napproved Stanford-related business travel, in accordance with Stanford’s travel\nreimbursement policies.\n8. Remote work arrangements must be approved by the Dean or Associate Dean, Vice or\nAssociate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate Vice President or designee of the department\nas well as the local senior HR Manager. Employees who are approved for a Remote work\narrangement must sign the Remote Work Agreement, and any other documents the\ndepartment or university may require. The Remote Work Agreement should be reviewed\nand renewed by the manager and employee periodically but no less frequently than\nannually.\n9. HR Managers or their delegates are required to ensure all employees in an approved\nRemote work arrangement have a Remote Work Agreement that complies with this policy\nand is signed by the employee, manager, local senior HR Manager and the Dean or\nAssociate Dean, Vice or Associate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate Vice President or\ndesignee of the department. In addition, HR Managers or their delegates must keep the HR\ninformation system up-to-date with the location from which the employee works. The\nRemote Work Agreement may specify an end date; however, even if an end date is\nspecified, the university reserves the right to modify or discontinue the agreement.\n10. Remote employees must obtain approval from the Dean or Associate Dean, Vice or\nAssociate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate Vice President or designee of the department,\nor their designee, as well as the local senior HR Manager if they wish to relocate their\nremote workspace to a different city, state and/or country, prior to such relocation.\n11. Remote work arrangements may be modified on an ongoing basis or discontinued at any\ntime at the university’s sole discretion, or at the request of the employee, with reasonable\nnotice, typically four (4) weeks. In such an event, the department may consider offering the\nRemote employee the opportunity to work at a Stanford Work Location that the department\ndeems appropriate, but is under no obligation to do so. Nothing in this Administrative Guide\nMemo requires the department to retain a Remote employee whom the department would\notherwise terminate or lay off, consistent with university policies.\nb. Equipment\n1. Generally, the university does not maintain an equipped workspace at a Stanford Work\nLocation for Remote employees. Accordingly, departments are required to provide\nreasonable reimbursement for and/or supply the equipment, services and supplies deemed\nby the university to be reasonable and necessary to enable Remote employees to perform\ntheir Stanford work, all in accordance with Stanford’s policies governing reimbursement of\nbusiness expenses. Regular employees (as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/definitions)) in Remote work arrangements will be provided with a one-time taxable\npayment of $750 to purchase basic home office equipment to ensure a productive and safe\nhome work environment. All other employees should work with their department to request\nany necessary equipment, services, and supplies. For additional information regarding\nbasic home office equipment purchasing resources and ergonomic needs, see Home Office\nEquipment and Expense Guidelines (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/working-\nstanford/flexible-work/flexible-work-arrangements-policies#equipment).\n2. Employees approved or designated by their department to work under a Remote work\narrangement are responsible to ensure that their remote workspace is ergonomically\nappropriate by completing an ergonomic assessment through EH&S. See Stanford’s\nErgonomics Program (https://ehs.stanford.edu/topic/ergonomics).\n3. Employees who are approved or designated by their department to work under a Remote\nwork arrangement are responsible to ensure their remote workspace has adequate internet\nconnectivity to perform their work, including video conferencing.\n4. Employees in Remote work arrangements are eligible for a stipend for cell phone and/or\nhome Internet connectivity as outlined in Guide Memo 8.1.3: Provision of Mobile Equipment\nand Related Services (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/services/communication-\nand-mail-services/provision-mobile-equipment-and-related-services).  \n5. Procedure\n1. Current employees who wish to transition to a Remote work arrangement should discuss\ntheir request with their manager.\n2. The manager will review the request with their local senior HR Manager and the Dean or\nAssociate Dean, Vice or Associate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate Vice President or\ndesignee of the department, or their designee.\n3. If the department believes a Remote work arrangement may be suitable, the employee\nshould complete the Remote Work Agreement and send it to their manager for review.\n(Managers can obtain the agreement through their HR Manager.)\n4. If approved, the employee, manager, local senior HR Manager and the Dean or Associate\nDean, Vice or Associate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate Vice President or designee of\nthe department should sign the Remote Work Agreement and follow all requirements in this\npolicy.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/remote-work-arrangements",

In this Guide Memo, these casual and temporary\nstaff employees are referred to as “contingent employee(s).”\n1. Accrual\na. Eligibility\nContingent employees delineated in the Applicability section above accrue and use sick time as\ndescribed below.\nb. Accrual of Sick Time\nContingent employees accrue sick time at the rate of .03334 hours per hour of straight\ntime. This equates to one (1) hour for every 30 hours worked.\nUnused sick time accumulates from year to year, with a maximum limit of 80 hours or ten\n(10) days.\nWhen a contingent employee leaves one position and accepts another one within the\nUniversity, the contingent employee retains their sick time balance; the contingent\nemployee is subject to any policies applicable to the new position regarding sick time use\nand limits on sick time accruals. \nIf a contingent employee separates from the University and is rehired by the University\nwithin 12 months from the date of separation, previously accrued and unused paid sick\ndays shall be reinstated.\nSick time shall not be paid out upon separation of employment.\n2. Use of Sick Time\nContingent employees may begin using sick time on the 90th calendar day after the start of\nemployment with the University. Sick time must be accrued before it can be used. The use of sick\ndays is limited to 40 hours or five (5) scheduled work days each year of employment, whichever\nis greater. Sick time may only be used for an absence that a contingent employee has during\nscheduled work hours.\nSick time may be used for the following reasons:\na. Absence Due to Illness or Injury\nSick time may be used when a contingent employee’s illness or injury prevents the contingent\nemployee from working.\nb. Medical and Dental Appointments\nSick time may be used for all medical and dental appointments, including: \nDiagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition\nPreventative care\nThose appointments associated with a work injury (e.g., physical therapy)\nc. Qualifying Act of Violence\n“Qualifying act of violence” means any of the following, regardless of whether anyone is arrested\nfor, prosecuted for, or convicted of committing any crime:\n(A) Domestic violence\n(B) Sexual assault\n(C) Stalking\n(D) An act, conduct, or pattern of conduct that includes any of the following:\n(i) In which an individual causes bodily injury or death to another individual.\n(ii) In which an individual exhibits, draws, brandishes, or uses a firearm, or other dangerous\nweapon, with respect to another individual.\n(iii) In which an individual uses or makes a reasonably perceived or actual threat to use force\nagainst another individual to cause physical injury or death.\nSick time may be used by a contingent employee who is a victim of or who has a family member\nwho is a victim of a qualifying act of violence in order to:\nObtain or attempt to obtain any relief, including, but not limited to, a temporary restraining\norder, restraining order, or other injunctive relief, to help ensure the health, safety, or\nwelfare of the victim or their child\nObtain or attempt to obtain any relief for the family member, including but not limited to a\ntemporary restraining order, restraining order, or other injunctive relief, to help ensure the\nhealth, safety, or welfare of the family member of the victim\nSeek, obtain, or assist a family member to seek or obtain medical attention for or to recover\nfrom injuries caused by a qualifying act of violence\nSeek, obtain, or assist a family member to seek or obtain services from a domestic\nviolence shelter, program, rape crisis center, or victim services organization or agency as a\nresult of a qualifying act of violence\nSeek, obtain, or assist a family member to seek or obtain psychological counseling or\nmental health services related to an experience of a qualifying act of violence\nParticipate in safety planning and take other actions to increase safety from future\nqualifying acts of violence\nRelocate or engage in the process of securing a new residence due to the qualifying act of\nviolence, including, but not limited to, securing temporary or permanent housing or enrolling\nchildren in a new school or child care\nProvide care to a family member who is recovering from injuries caused by a qualifying act\nof violence\nSeek, obtain, or assist a family member to seek or obtain civil or criminal legal services in\nrelation to the qualifying act of violence\nPrepare for, participate in, or attend any civil, administrative, or criminal legal proceeding\nrelated to the qualifying act of violence\nSeek, obtain, or provide child care or care to a care-dependent adult if the child care or\ncare is necessary to ensure the safety of the child or dependent adult as a result of a\nqualifying act of violence\nSick time used for any purpose described in this subsection that is for a family member shall be\ndesignated as Family Sick Time (see section 2.d. below). \nd. Family Sick Time\nContingent employees may use sick time for diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health\ncondition of, or preventive care for, a contingent employee's family member or for any purpose in\naccordance with section 2.c. above that is for a family member. For the purpose of this policy,\nfamily member includes, as the terms are defined by law, only the contingent employee's:\nSpouse or registered domestic partner\nChildren of the contingent employee or spouse or registered domestic partner (including a\nbiological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child to whom the contingent\nemployee stands in loco parentis, regardless of the child’s age or dependency status)\nParents and parents-in-law (including a biological, adoptive, or foster parent, stepparent, or\nlegal guardian of a contingent employee or the contingent employee’s spouse or registered\ndomestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the contingent employee\nwas a minor)\nBrothers and sisters\nGrandparents or grandchildren\nContingent employees may use up to 40 hours or five (5) days of their accrued sick time for\ndiagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a\ndesignated person, or for any purpose in accordance with section 2.c. above that is for the\ndesignated person. “Designated person” means a person identified by the contingent employee\nat the time the contingent employee requests paid sick days. A contingent employee is limited to\none “designated person” per 12-month period for such paid sick days.\n3. Administration\na. Notification of Absence\nThe contingent employee reports an absence (or planned absence) to the supervisor. The\ndepartment is responsible for establishing and communicating rules on how contingent\nemployees notify the department of absences. If the need for sick time use is foreseeable, the\ncontingent employee shall provide reasonable advance notice. If the need for sick time use is\nunforeseeable, the contingent employee shall provide notice of the need for sick time use as\nsoon as practicable. If a contingent employee has accrued sick time available and has not\nreached the applicable limits of sick time use per year of employment, a request to use sick time\nshould not be denied because details are not provided about sick time use. Contingent\nemployees may be asked to schedule appointments at a time convenient for the department.\nWhere flexible schedules work for the department, supervisors are encouraged to accommodate\nappointments",

    "text": "ingent\nemployees may be asked to schedule appointments at a time convenient for the department.\nWhere flexible schedules work for the department, supervisors are encouraged to accommodate\nappointments by flexing a contingent employee’s work hours.\nb. Recording and Reporting Sick Time Accumulation and Use\nThe University uses the human resources management system (Axess/PeopleSoft HRMS) to\nrecord sick time credited, used, and accumulated for all contingent employees. Contingent\nemployees record hours of sick time used in the Axess timecard each pay period. The use of sick\ntime is limited to 40 hours (or five scheduled workdays, whichever is greater) during each year of\nemployment. Up to 40 hours of sick time use may be recorded in Axess; if a contingent employee\nhas three scheduled work days of sick time use that exceeds 40 hours, the contingent employee\nshould request assistance from the local Human Resources Office. Contingent employees are\nnot paid for time spent away from work in excess of the sick time limit per year of employment,\nand such time is not recorded in Axess. (For information about Axess, see the Time & Leave\nSystem overview\n(http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payemployee/time_leave_reporting.html) on the\nFingate website.)\nc. Sick Time Credit Date\nSick time is credited at the beginning of each month of service, calculated based on work hours\nrecorded during the previous month. If a contingent employee needs to use sick time that has\nbeen accrued but not yet credited in Axess, the contingent employee should speak to the local\nHuman Resources Office for assistance.\nd. Tax Status\nSick time is taxable income. Federal, state, and FICA taxes are deducted.\ne. Medical Confirmation\n(1) Medical Confirmation Related to Use of Sick Time\nAcceptable medical evidence may be required for the use of sick time. However, for a contingent\nemployee’s use of the first 40 hours of sick time (or five scheduled work days, whichever is\ngreater) during each year of employment, excepting circumstances involving abuse or misuse of\nsick time as stated in subpart (2) below, supervisors may not require acceptable medical\nevidence, and supervisors should not deny sick time use based on a contingent employee’s\nfailure to provide details about the sick time use. The supervisor who approves the use of sick\ntime is responsible for confirming that the conditions for the use of sick time are met.\n(2) Medical Confirmation Related to Possible Abuse or Misuse of Sick Time\nIf the University has a reasonable basis to believe that a contingent employee may have\nengaged in abuse or misuse of sick time at any time (even during the first 40 hours or five (5)\nscheduled workdays of sick time use during each year of employment), the University may ask\nfor acceptable medical evidence or other proof showing that a contingent employee has not\nengaged in abuse or misuse of sick time. Abuse or misuse of sick time, failure to follow sick time\nnotification procedures (e.g., failing to provide reasonable advance notice for foreseeable sick\ntime use, not providing requested medical information when abuse or misuse is suspected, or\nnot giving notice as soon as practicable for unforeseeable sick time use) may be a basis for\ndiscipline, up to and including termination of employment. Also, use of sick time may be denied if\nthere is abuse or misuse of sick time.\n(3) Acceptable Medical Evidence\nAcceptable medical evidence includes, but is not limited to, a health care practitioner’s statement\nthat certifies a medical need for sick time, the expected duration of absence and anticipated\nreturn to work date, and any work-related limitations or restrictions (including the duration of\nthose limitations or restrictions) when the contingent employee is released to return to work.\nf. Sources of Funds for Sick Time\nAs sick time is used to replace scheduled work hours, it should be recorded in Axess on the\ntimecard associated with the job for which the work time was scheduled. Sick time used is\ncharged to the department that owns this job record.\ng. Applicable Laws\nThe intent of this Guide Memo 2.1.22 is to meet or exceed the requirements of all applicable\nlaws, including, without limitation, the California Paid Sick Leave Law enacted by Assembly Bill\n1522 and Senate Bill 616.\n4. Disability Insurance and Family Temporary Disability\na. Voluntary Disability Insurance (VDI) and Short Term Disability (STD)\nThe VDI and STD plans provide partial income continuation for periods of disability. Stanford’s\nVDI and STD plans are administered by Lincoln Financial and there are specific rules regarding\ndisability insurance benefits, including rules about eligibility and duration. For more information,\ncontingent employees should contact their supervisors, the applicable local Human Resources\noffice, or contact the University HR Service Team (http://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-\nrewards/contact-us); they also may contact Lincoln Financial at (800) 896-9375 or submit a claim\nat https://www.mylincolnportal.com (https://www.mylincolnportal.com) (claimant service ID:\nstanford).\nb. Family Temporary Disability (FTD)\nFTD provides partial income replacement to care for seriously ill family members or to bond with\na new child. Stanford’s FTD plan is administered by Lincoln Financial, and there are specific\nrules regarding the FTD benefit, including rules about eligibility. For more information, contingent\nemployees should contact their supervisors, the applicable local Human Resources office, or\ncontact the University HR Service Team (http://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-\nrewards/contact-us); they also may contact Lincoln Financial at (800) 896-9375 or submit a claim\nat https://www.mylincolnportal.com (https://www.mylincolnportal.com) (claimant service ID:\nstanford).     \nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/sick-time-temporary-and-casual-staff-employees",

This guide\nmemo sets forth policies and procedures to facilitate the establishment, use and maintenance of\npersonnel data, in whatever form maintained.\nApplicability:\nApplies to regular employees (as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/definitions): Definitions), Academic Staff - Research, and Academic Staff - Libraries. For\npolicies that apply to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, refer to the\nagreements between Stanford University and SEIU Higher Education Workers Local 2007 and\nthe Stanford University and the Stanford Deputy Sheriffs' Association. Agreements can be found\nat Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/hr-processes-\npolicies/labor-relations-collective-bargaining). \nWhile these policy statements are applicable to all University staff, the SLAC Human Resources\nDepartment maintains its own centralized personnel files and should be contacted for specific\nprocedural information relating to personnel files for SLAC employees.\n1. Definition\nEmployee Personnel Files are defined to include the application for employment, and records\nwhich are used or have been used to determine an employee's qualifications for promotion,\ncompensation, termination, or disciplinary action. A detailed list of appropriate contents is\nprovided in Section 3.\n2. Location\nBecause of the decentralized personnel function at Stanford, the documents which form an\nemployee's personnel file can be found (1) on computerized record-keeping systems and/or\ndigital imaging systems, (2) locally in the Dean's, Director's, Vice Provost's or Vice President's\noffice, (3) in the department head's or supervisor's office, (4) in the Payroll office, and/or (5) at\nthe Personnel Records area at SLAC. All such documents comprise the personnel file.\n3. Contents\nEmployee personnel files should contain only that information which is directly related to the\nemployee's job duties, salary, performance and general employment history. Medical files, where\napplicable, must be maintained separately from other files (see Guide to Supervisors on next\npage). Listed in the three following subsections are many types of documents which, if they exist,\nare appropriate for retention in employee personnel files. Documents that have not been shared\nwith the employee and the supervisor do not belong in the file(s).\na. Personnel Files and Data Maintained by the Department/Division:\nAttendance and Absence Records (Note: At SLAC, these items are located in Payroll)\nFor areas that do not use PeopleSoft HRMS, and for periods of time that predate the\nimplementation of PeopleSoft HRMS:\nLeave of absence correspondence (includes vacation and PTO)\nTime sheets: TTR, RHT, Hours Worked Record (SU-28); at SLAC, located in Payroll\nVacation and sick leave records; at SLAC, located in Payroll\nYearly leave records; at SLAC, located in Payroll\nOffer and/or confirmation of employment letters\nClassification review letters addressed to employee\nCopies of compliance agreements and other University-required agreements, such as\nHIPAA and those related to use of patents or confidential personnel information/data\nDisciplinary memos issued to employee\nI-9 documents and supporting documentation (SLAC)\nJob application and any attachments (resume, etc.)\nJob descriptions\nJob requisitions\nLayoff notice issued to employee\nPerformance evaluations issued to employee; employee responses thereto\nPersonnel action forms (PAF)\nPhoto ID where required (SLAC)\nResignation letter\nSTAP forms and related documents\nTermination notice issued to employee\nTransfer or promotion requests\nYears of applicable experience calculation\nb.

Access by the Employee or Representative\nEach employee or their authorized representative may review the employee’s own local\npersonnel files by requesting an appointment with the local Human Resources office during\nregular business hours and non-working time. An employee or their authorized representative\nmay review the employee’s own payroll and related forms by making an appointment with and\npresenting appropriate identification to the Payroll office. An authorized representative must\npresent a written authorization signed by the employee permitting the representative to make\nsuch inspection. Such appointments generally will occur, unless agreed in writing, within 30 days\nafter the written request for inspection is submitted.\nA Human Resources or Payroll staff member will remain present during the time the file is\nreviewed, allowing sufficient inspection time commensurate with the volume of the file. The\nemployee or authorized representative is permitted to take notes during the inspection.\nAn employee or their authorized representative may also request a copy of the personnel file.\nThe authorized representative must present written proof, signed by the employee, that the\nrepresentative is authorized to receive a copy of the personnel file.

Requests for a copy of payroll records, however, must be\nprovided within 21 days of receipt of the employee’s request. Current employees can also\naccess their payroll records, including W-2s and time and leave records, at any time in the Axess\nportal.\nb. Access by a Former Employee\nA former employee of the University or their authorized representative may request a copy of\ntheir personnel file for up to three years after termination. The request must be in writing, and the\nrepresentative must provide written proof signed by the employee authorizing the representative\nto request and receive a copy of the personnel file. Generally such requests will be granted once\neach year and the copy provided within 30 days after receipt of the written request, unless the\nUniversity and the employee (or authorized representative) agree otherwise. The copy of the file\nmay be provided at the former employee's expense. Requests by a former employee for a copy\nof their payroll records must be provided within 21-days of receipt of the former employee’s\nrequest.\nc. Access by University Officials\nUniversity officers, managers, deans, department heads, Human Resources professionals,\nrepresentatives of the General Counsel's office, and other University officials with a business\nneed to do so may review individual files. This access is also extended to hiring officers within\nthe University when the employee is a finalist for promotion or transfer.\nd. Access by Summons/Subpoenas\nProcess servers with summons or subpoenas for documents contained in an individual\nemployee's personnel file should be directed to Payroll, or to the Manager of Employee & Labor\nRelations at SLAC. Departments are not authorized to accept service of summons or subpoenas.\ne. Outside Employment Verification Requests (Former and Current\nEmployees)\nStanford does not respond directly to any employment verification requests. Stanford contracts\nwith a third party service supplier to provide employment, salary, and immigration verification\nservices. Employees should follow the instructions at Stanford's Gateway to Financial Activities\n(http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/payemployee/emp_verification.html) for employment verification.\nRequests for information on SLAC employees should be referred to the SLAC Human Resources\nDepartment.\nf. Access by Agents of the University\nAgents of the University are required by contract to certify that University personnel data will be\ntreated confidentially and only used for the purposes specified in the contract.\ng. Requests for Employment References (Former & Current Employees)\nRequests from outside the University for employment references should be directed to the local\nHuman Resources office. Requests for information about SLAC employees should be referred to\nthe SLAC Human Resources Department. Information other than the dates of employment and\njob classification requires the employee's written consent before the release of information.\n5. Maintenance and Retention\na. Current Employees\nAn employee's work history at Stanford may include service with many different departments. To\nstreamline recordkeeping, the local personnel files should follow the employee from one\ndepartment to the next, thereby creating a consolidated personnel file containing the employee's\ncomplete job history. Local personnel files must be kept in a secure location to prevent\nunauthorized access.\nNo one should be responsible for maintenance of their own personnel file or data. For example,\nthe personnel file of a department or school's file administrator should be maintained by that\nindividual's supervisor or manager, as appropriate.\nb. Terminated Employees\nThe final department where a former employee worked is responsible for ensuring that\nappropriate records are retained for the requisite length of time. Records of former Stanford\nemployees should be retained for eight years following the date of termination.\nc. Destruction of Outdated Information\nPersonnel files contain confidential information and must be destroyed by shredding, incinerating\nor, in the case of digital records, purged by the system administrator. When the requisite period\nof data retention has passed, the records should be destroyed. Contact University Human\nResources/Employee & Labor Relations or the SLAC Human Resources Department before the\ndestruction or purging of any personnel information.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/personnel-files-and-data",

Overview\na. Background and Purpose\nThe University is separate and independent of Stanford Health Care (SHC). Each entity\nmaintains its own Human Resources department, employment policies and employee benefits.\nThis Guide Memo explains when the hire date from Stanford Health Services (SHS), Lucile\nPackard Children's Hospital (LPCH), UCSF Stanford Health Care (USHC), or SHC will be used\ninstead of the new University hire date for certain University benefits for eligible employees.\nb. Definitions\nFor purposes of this Guide Memo, the following definitions apply:\nEmployed - earning wages or on an approved leave of absence from a regular position\neligible for health and welfare benefits with the applicable employer.\nSHS Hire Date - the actual date of hire at SHS.\nLPCH Hire Date - the later of January 17, 1997, or the actual date of hire at LPCH.\nUSHC Hire Date - the actual date of hire at USHC.\nSHC Hire Date - the actual date of hire at SHC.\n2. Eligibility Requirements\na.

The Tuition Grant Program benefits\ndescribed in section 8 uses its own definition of Eligible Employee.\nb. Direct Change\nAn eligible employee must \"change directly\" to employment with the University. For purposes of\nthis policy, a direct change occurs when the employee ceases employment with SHC on one\nbusiness day and commences employment with the University on the next University business\nday.\n3. Pay Rate\nAn eligible employee who becomes a University employee receives a rate of pay consistent with\nthe guidelines that apply to internal University transfers and promotions.\n4. Voluntary Change\nAn eligible employee who at their own discretion applies for and accepts University employment\nis considered to have made a voluntary change of employers. In such situations, the following\ncriteria apply for benefits eligibility:\na. The most recent University hire date\nwill be used to determine the period of continuous University employment for:\nLayoff and severance\nTuition Grant Program eligibility, except as provided in section 8\nStaff Development Program — Guide Memo 2.1.12\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/staff-development-programs): Staff Development Program\nb. The SHS, LPCH, USHC or SHC hire date as defined in 1.b\nwill be used to determine:\nVacation accrual rate\nEligibility for participation and vesting in any University retirement plans\nEligibility for and participation in any University-sponsored retiree medical plans\nc. Verification Required\nWhere the SHS, LPCH, USHC or SHC hire date is to be used for purposes specified in section\n4.b., the hiring supervisor must verify that hire date with Human Resources Management at\nSHC.\nd. Previous University Employment\nWhere the SHS, LPCH, or SHC hire date occurred upon a direct change of employment from the\nUniversity, the preceding University hire date plus service while employed at SHC or its\npredecessors will be used for purposes specified in section 4.b.\n5. Involuntary Change\nOccasionally management of SHC may determine that a function performed by a staff member\nwill no longer be provided. If the University offers such an employee the option of continuing their\nposition as a University employee, it is considered an involuntary change of employer and the\nfollowing policies will apply if the employee is eligible:\na. The most recent University hire date\nwill be used to determine the period of continuous University employment for:\nTuition Grant Program eligibility, except as provided in section 8, below\nStaff Development Program — Guide Memo 2.1.12\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/staff-development-programs): Staff Development Program\nb. The SHS, LPCH, USHC or SHC hire date\nas defined above in 1.b will be used to determine the period of continuous University\nemployment for:\nLayoff and severance\nVacation accrual rate\nEligibility for participation and vesting in any University retirement plans\nEligibility for and participation in any University-sponsored retiree medical plans\nc. Verification Required\nWhere the SHS, LPCH, USHC or SHC hire date is to be used for purposes specified in section\n5.b., the hiring supervisor must verify that hire date with Human Resources Management at\nSHC.\nd. Previous University Employment\nWhere the SHS, LPCH, or SHC hire date occurred upon a direct change of employment from the\nUniversity, the preceding University hire date plus service while employed at SHC or its\npredecessors will be used for purposes specified in section 5.b.\n6. Layoff from USHC OR SHC\nAn employee who accepts layoff and severance from USHC or SHC and subsequently hired by\nthe University will be considered a new employee and the SHS, LPCH, USHC or SHC hire date\nshall not be used for any purpose.\n7. Trial Period\nAll employees who become University employees will serve a new trial period with the University,\neven if they have completed a trial period at SHS, LPCH, USHC or SHC or in previous positions\nat the University.\n8. Tuition Grant Program (TGP)\na. Eligible Employee\nFor purposes of Section 8.a and 8.b, an eligible employee is a person whose job transferred from\nthe University to SHC, USHC, or SHS because of one of the business transactions specified\nbelow, and who was actively employed by the University on the Applicable Date related to the\nspecific transaction, as shown in the chart below.

    "text": "2.1.5 Compensation of Staff Employees\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Human Resources.\nLast Updated\nJanuary 6, 2023\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 22.4\nThis Guide Memo outlines Stanford University's compensation policies.\nApplicability:\nApplies to regular employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and Academic\nStaff-Libraries as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/definitions): Definitions. For policies that apply to employees covered by a collective\nbargaining agreement, refer to the agreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining\n(http://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/hr-processes-policies/labor-relations-collective-bargaining) for\ndetails. This policy also applies to:\nTemporary and casual employees, where specified\nSLAC, but implementation procedures may differ\nPolicy Statement:\nIt is Stanford University's policy to pay salaries that reflect the duties and responsibilities of the\nposition and the scope and complexity of the work performed. This policy and Stanford’s\ncompensation practices are designed to set pay that is competitive in the geographic region\nwhere work is performed and ensure that pay is managed in a consistent, equitable manner\nregardless of funding sources. It is also the intention of the university to set salary ranges that\nprovide competitive pay comparable with relevant labor markets. Consistent with its obligations\nunder the law, Stanford shall not discharge, or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against,\nemployees or applicants because they have discussed, inquired about, or disclosed their own\npay or the pay of another employee or applicant. For questions or further information, contact\nyour local Human Resources office or University Human Resources Staff Compensation.\n1. Information Sources\nUniversity compensation policies and procedures for staff employees are described in this Guide\nMemo and these publications and memoranda:\na. Annual memoranda that describe the salary program, issued by the Vice President for\nHuman Resources. These memoranda include current compensation policies and\nprocedures, and salary structures that are reviewed and approved each year.\nb. To find specific administrative information on the staff compensation program, policies, and\nsalary structures, see the Compensation (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-\nrewards/compensation) website.\n2. Hours of Work and Work Records\na. Workweek\nThe basic full-time workweek is 40 hours of work on five consecutive eight-hour days. The\nstandard week is a seven-day period commencing at 12:01 a.m. Monday and ending at midnight\nthe following Sunday. Salaried staff employed for a work week of less than the basic 40-hour\nweek receive reduced salary based on the ratio of hours worked to 40 hours. Staff employees\nwho are employed at an hourly rate are paid for the actual time worked.\nStraight time is time worked up to eight hours a day and 40 hours a week unless the employee is\non an alternative work schedule (see section 6, Alternative Work Schedule).\nb. Nonstandard Workweek\nDepartments may establish other workweek schedules or work arrangements to meet their\nrequirements, including a workweek that begins and ends on other days or hours than the basic\nworkweek (outlined in section 3.a), if approved in advance by the local Human Resources office.\nSee guidelines at Flexible Work Options (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/manage-\nlead/employees/manage-your-team/work-life-integration/flexible-work-schedule).\nc. Make-Up Time\nAt the written request of the employee, and with the approval of the supervisor, a non-exempt\nemployee may reduce their work hours for a personal obligation on one day and make up the\nhours not worked on another day during the same workweek. The employee may do this by\nworking more than eight hours but not more than 11 hours in one day, with the understanding\nthat no overtime premium will be paid unless the total number of hours worked in any one day\nexceeds 11 hours or the total number of hours worked in any one workweek exceeds 40.\nd. Day of Rest\nNon-exempt employees working more than 30 hours a week are entitled to have at least one day\noff in seven in compliance with California state law.\ne. Rest Breaks\nThe university provides non-exempt employees a 15-minute paid, duty-free rest break for each\nfour hours of work or \"major fraction\" of four hours of work (i.e., more than two hours), provided\nthe employees work at least three-and-one-half hours per day. Insofar as practicable, rest breaks\nshould be scheduled in the middle of each work period. Rest breaks are duty-free time and\nemployees are free to leave the premises, where practicable. Rest breaks should also be\narranged so that disruptions of work and services are held to a minimum. Employees are not\npermitted to use their rest breaks to shorten the workday or to extend the meal period. If a non-\nexempt employee is not provided the required number of duty-free rest breaks in a day and/or is\nnot relieved of all duty during their rest breaks, a penalty of one hour of pay at the employee's\nregular rate must be paid to the employee.\nf. Meal Periods\nMeal periods normally are for one hour and are unpaid. Time taken for meal periods is not part of\nthe work day, provided the employee is relieved of all duty. A non-exempt employee must be\nprovided with an unpaid meal period of at least 30 minutes after no more than five hours of work,\nand a second meal period of at least 30 minutes after no more than ten hours of work, unless the\nemployee waives the right to the second meal period. A non-exempt employee who works no\nmore than six hours in the workday may also waive the right to a meal period if the supervisor\napproves. Such waivers require the employee’s consent, can be revoked by the employee at any\ntime, and are recommended to be in writing. Supervisors should consult with their local Human\nResources office before agreeing to waive an employee’s meal period.\nIf a non-exempt employee is not provided with a 30-minute, duty-free meal period and/or is not\nrelieved of all duty during a meal period, then the time must be recorded as work hours.\nAdditionally, a penalty of one hour of pay at the employee's regular rate must be paid to the\nemployee for any missed, late, or otherwise non-compliant meal period.\ng. Note to Supervisors\nUnpaid meal breaks, including actual start and stop times, must be recorded in each employee's\nAxess Timecard. If a meal break is not provided, a one-hour penalty must also be recorded.\nh. Work Records\n1. Records for Non-Exempt Employees\nFederal and state laws require non-exempt employees to keep an accurate daily record of hours\nactually worked, including actual start and stop times and meal breaks. Axess Timecard, in the\nhuman resources management system (HRMS) is the system of record to indicate hours worked,\nincluding overtime hours and vacation, sick, holiday and other leave time taken by each non-\nexempt employee. In the time-keeping system, records must be updated by the end of each pay\nperiod, but it is recommended that employees update their actual work hours each work day.\nSupervisors (or their departmental designees) must approve non-exempt employees' time\nrecords and must approve any variance from the employees' normally scheduled work hours.\nAlso see Guide Memo 2.1.6 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-\nemployment-policies/vacations): Vacations, Guide Memo 2.1.7\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/sick-time-\nregular-staff-employees-regular): Sick Time, Guide Memo 2.1.8\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/miscellaneous-authorized-absences): Miscellaneous Authorized Absences, and Guide\nMemo 2.1.13 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/paid-holidays): Paid Holidays.\n2.

In that\nsystem, records must be updated by the end of each pay period. For exempt employees it is not\nnecessary to report any vacation, PTO or Floating Holiday time less than four hours. For\nreporting purposes of four or more hours, record a minimum of four hours or the actual time\ntaken if over four hours. Sick time may be taken in any increment. In the case of intermittent\nFamily and Medical Leave, the local Human Resources office must be consulted to ensure that\n(a) accurate records are maintained of time used for Family and Medical Leave, and (b) the\nemployee's leave balance is properly reduced for time charged to intermittent Family and\nMedical Leave. Supervisors (or their departmental designees) must approve exempt employees'\nleave records.\nAlso see Guide Memo 2.1.6 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-\nemployment-policies/vacations): Vacations, Guide Memo 2.1.7\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/sick-time-\nregular-staff-employees-regular): Sick Time, Guide Memo 2.1.8\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/miscellaneous-authorized-absences): Miscellaneous Authorized Absences and Guide\nMemo 2.1.13 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/paid-holidays): Paid Holidays.\n3. Records for Non-Employees\nStanford is not required to keep a record of hours for consultants or employees of another\nemployer with whom the university has a contract for service.\n3. Pay Administration\nThe Vice President for Human Resources administers the overall salary program, including\nestablishing staff job classifications, maintaining location-based salary structures, and developing\njob-specific regional market pay ranges. University Human Resources Staff Compensation is\nresponsible for providing guidance to local Human Resource Managers to ensure jobs are\nproperly classified, and base pay is set appropriately and managed in a consistent, equitable\nmanner. University Human Resources Staff Compensation proactively reviews and approves all\npay actions for Remote employees to ensure pay is managed in alignment with the applicable\nsalary structure and program guidelines, and is equitable with pay of Stanford employees in\nsimilar roles. The Vice Presidents, Vice Provosts, Deans and Directors are responsible for\nmanaging  pay and classification actions in their area(s) in a manner consistent with this policy\nand compensation program guidelines. \na. Base Pay\nBase pay is set for each job based on market survey data and managed within the parameters\nestablished by the applicable salary structure. Pay for employees in On-site and Hybrid work\narrangements and Remote employees who perform work within the 10-county area is set and\nmanaged based on the Stanford Work Location Salary Structure\n(https://drive.google.com/file/d/10_Lq07YycwAKXuIKF7X0W1NvT_5WdPcb/view?\nusp=sharing). Pay for remote employees who perform work working outside the 10-county area\nis set and managed based on one of the four Regional Salary Structures\n(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ulfJcCeFgFqGOQk4lHik3MIU8aKGi28p/view?\nusp=sharing) determined by the location where work is performed. See Guide Memo 2.1.21\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/remote-\nwork-arrangements) for definitions of On-site, Hybrid, Remote, and 10-county area. Upon\nrequest to their supervisor or local Human Resources Manager, employees will be provided the\npay range for their current position.\nb. Minimum Wage\nIn compliance with federal and state laws, employees must be paid the current minimum wage or\nhigher unless a request for a specific exception is allowable under the law and approved by the\nVice President for Human Resources. Information on the current minimum wage rate is available\nfrom University Human Resources Staff Compensation.\nc. Non-Cash Compensation\nWhen the university provides perquisites such as room, apartment, or meals, their value (as\ndetermined under tax laws) is added to cash compensation (and the employee’s regular rate of\npay if required by law) to establish total base pay for computation of insured benefits. When\nrequired to be taken as a condition of employment, perquisites are not subject to federal income\ntax.\nd. Performance Increases\nStaff employees are eligible for pay increases based on performance. Pay increases are not\nautomatic. Internal pay relationships and relevant market information are considered in setting\npay increases.\n4. Overtime Compensation\na. Employees Exempt from Overtime Compensation\n(1) Definition of Exempt Employee\nCertain employees hold jobs that are exempt from governmental regulations regarding\ncompensation for overtime work. In general, employees are exempt when employed in\nexecutive, administrative or learned, creative or computer professional positions as defined by\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act and California law. Exempt University employees are not entitled to\nreceive overtime pay.\nThe Vice President for Human Resources or designee determines the exempt or non-exempt\nstatus of university classifications. Special circumstances, such as an employee working in more\nthan one job (also referred to as a dual appointment) that may affect their exempt status, must\nbe discussed with the local Human Resources office before hiring employees into additional jobs.\nNormal Expectations - Because of the many activities required to keep the university\nfunctioning, full-time members of the academic staff and regular exempt staff may be called upon\nto perform a variety of services for the institution apart from those normally considered to be their\nregular job duties. These staff members may be assigned these tasks either within their\ndepartment or for another area within the university.\nFurther, it is understood that regular academic and exempt staff may often be expected to work\nin excess of 40 hours a week. Because these situations are considered to fall within the normal\nexpectations for these staff, they would not constitute grounds for payment of additional\ncompensation and the staff member would not receive payment in excess of 100% of the FTE\nsalary.\nIf an employee receives a request to perform additional work for a department other than the\nemployee's home department assignment (whether related or unrelated to the employee's\ncurrent responsibilities), the employee must receive formal approval in advance from their\nsupervisor or provide notification to the supervisor, depending on the duties:\nFor non-teaching duties, the employee must receive prior written approval from their\ncurrent supervisor and the local Human Resources Office.\nFor teaching duties:\nIf the teaching duties occur outside the employee's normal work schedule, the\nemployee must give prior written notification to their current supervisor and the local\nHuman Resources office.\nIf preparation and/or teaching duties occur during the employee's normal work\nschedule, the employee must receive prior written approval from their current\nsupervisor and the local Human Resources Office.\n(2) Further Information\nFor regular non-bargaining unit staff and academic staff-libraries, contact your Human Resources\noffice.\nb. Overtime Entitlement\nAny employee holding a non-exempt job and who is required to work more than eight hours in a\nday, or more than 40 hours in a week, is entitled to compensation in accordance with (1) below.\nThe total hours worked for one or more departments of the university are to be counted in\ndetermining overtime even though employm",

    "text": "in a week, is entitled to compensation in accordance with (1) below.\nThe total hours worked for one or more departments of the university are to be counted in\ndetermining overtime even though employment in any one department does not exceed the\nstandard 8-hour day or 40-hour week. University policy provides for overtime payment for hours\nworked in excess of eight in one day in accordance with state regulations. University policy\nprovides overtime payment for hours worked in excess of 40 in one week in accordance with\nstate and federal regulations. Overtime policies are applicable to non-exempt temporary and/or\ncasual employees as well as to regular non-exempt employees. University requirements and\ngovernment regulations require that overtime hours worked by non-exempt employees be\nrecorded and compensated.\n(1) Overtime Rate\nThe university's policy is to compensate non-exempt employees at a premium rate of one-and-\none-half times the employee's regular rate of pay. For non-exempt employees, the regular rate is\nthe weekly salary, including any applicable premiums required to be added by law, divided by\nregular, non-overtime hours worked. For non-exempt employees who are paid more than one\nhourly rate in a pay period, the overtime rate will be calculated based on the weighted average\nmethod.  \nNon-exempt employees who work in excess of 12 hours per workday or in excess of eight\nhours on the seventh consecutive day of work in a single work week will be compensated\nfor those excess hours at the rate of twice their regular rate of pay.\nOvertime Rates:\na. Time and one-half: hours eight through 12 in one workday\nb. Double-time: hours after 12 in one workday\nc. Time and one-half: first eight hours on seventh consecutive workday\nd. Double-time: after eight hours on seventh consecutive workday\ne. Time and one-half: after 40 hours in one work week, unless a double-time premium\napplies\n(2) Overtime Hours\nAuthorized paid time off (e.g., vacation, sick leave, personal time off, holidays, etc.) counts as\ntime worked in determining if a non-exempt employee is entitled to overtime compensation.\nLeave without pay does not count as time worked.\n(3) Overtime Limitations\nOvertime work is to be kept to a minimum because of costs. Departments should permit overtime\nwork by non-exempt employees only when it is essential to the operation of the department.\nState law prohibits persons under age 18 from working more than eight hours per day under any\ncircumstances.\n(4) Approval of Overtime Work\nOvertime work by non-exempt employees requires approval in advance by the department head\nor a designated representative who has the authority to schedule work and approve overtime\ncompensation. Non-exempt employees cannot be authorized to schedule or approve overtime\nwork for themselves. Non-exempt employees cannot be authorized to work unpaid overtime. In\ncircumstances where a part-time employee plans to work in more than one job for the same or\nother department(s), the employee’s supervisors should contact the local Human Resources\noffice for consultation on both topics before implementation. In the event an employee works\novertime without obtaining the prior approval of their supervisor, the overtime hours must be\npaid, but the failure of the employee to follow this provision can be addressed through corrective\naction.\n(5) Approval of Extended Overtime\nDepartments finding it necessary to schedule overtime for one or more employees on a regular\nbasis for six months or longer as the only means of meeting work requirements, must obtain\napproval in advance from the appropriate Vice President or Vice Provost.\n5. Alternative Work Schedule\na. Definition\n\"Alternative work week\" refers to a schedule that allows non-exempt employees to work\na standard work week (40 hours) that is condensed into fewer than five full days. A common\nalternative work week schedule is four 10-hour days.\nb. Guidelines\nGuidelines for Flexible Work Options (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/working-\nstanford/flexible-work/flexible-work-arrangements-policies).\nc. Administrative Considerations\nManagers should consider their operational needs before implementing an alternative work\nschedule. For example, an alternative work schedule may be used in the academic departments\nwhere expanded service hours are needed to accommodate client needs during irregular hours\n(e.g., students or clients in other time zones), but may be impractical when 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\ncoverage is the priority.\nd. Alternative Work Schedule Election\nUpon secret ballot election by affected employees conducted in strict compliance with applicable\nlaws, and with the concurrence of management, non-exempt employees may work an\n\"alternative work week,\" such as four 10-hour work days, with the understanding that no overtime\npremium will be due unless the employee works more than 40 hours in any one week, or the\nsupervisor compels the employee to work more than the agreed upon hours in any work day. No\nalternative work schedule for non-exempt employees may be implemented unless it meets all\nlegal requirements and prerequisites and is reviewed in advance by Employee & Labor Relations\nin University Human Resources. Contact your local Human Resources office if you are interested\nin exploring the option of implementing an alternative work schedule, or consult with Employee &\nLabor Relations and review these guidelines for alternative work schedules or flexible work\noptions (https://hr.stanford.edu/processes/employee-labor-relations/flexible-work-options-\nconsultation).\n6. Special Compensation Situations for Non-Exempt\nEmployees\na. Call-Back Time\n\"Call-back\" time occurs when a non-exempt employee responds to an emergency call and\nreturns to work outside their normal working hours without advance notice. The minimum\ncompensation for \"call-back\" time is two hours pay. Compensation for \"call-back\" time includes\nall hours worked, including the actual time spent traveling to and from the \"call-back\" duty.\nb. Standby and Beeper Pay\nEmployees away from work may be required to remain accessible for consultation or to return to\nwork. Non-exempt employees assigned such duties are eligible to receive partial salary for the\nduration of the assignment depending on the extent to which that assignment restricts their\npersonal activities.\n(1) Beeper Pay\nIf that restriction is limited to carrying a \"beeper,\" cell phone or similar device, and remain within\nrange of the device, and be required to return any beeper page or call within 20 minutes, the\npartial salary is 5% of the employee's base pay for hours assigned to beeper duty, but not at\nwork (called \"beeper pay\"). Any time spent by the employee answering pages or calls or\nreturning to work is compensable at the employee’s base rate of pay or overtime regular rate, as\napplicable.\n(2) Standby Pay\nIf the restriction is narrower than discussed in (1) above, and the assignment requires the\nemployee to be prepared to return instantly to return to work, the partial salary is 50% of the\nemployee's base pay (which must be at least the minimum wage) for hours assigned to standby\nduty, but not at work (called \"standby pay\"). \nc. Shift Pay\nShift premiums are paid to non-exempt full-time employees assigned to shifts other than daytime\nschedules. Non-exempt employees working full-time and assigned to swing shifts (shifts starting\nbetween 2 p.m. and 10 p.m.) will be paid a 10% shift premium. Non-exempt employees working\nfull-time and assigned to owl/night shifts (shifts starting between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m.) will be paid\na 15% shift premium. \nNon-exempt employees who work swing shifts or owl/night shifts for their own convenience\nrather than to meet operational needs shall be considered to be assigned to daytime schedules\nand paid their normal hourly rate regardless of when the hours are actually worked.\nThis shift pay provision does not apply to sworn officers in the Department of Public Safety.\n7.

For policies that apply to staff\nemployees covered by collective bargaining agreements, refer to the agreements between Stanford\nUniversity and SEIU Higher Education Workers Local 2007 and Stanford University and the Stanford\nDeputy Sheriffs' Association. Agreements can be found at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/hr-processes-policies/labor-relations-collective-bargaining).\nProcedures for SLAC employees may vary. Contingent staff employees do not accrue vacation (see\nGuide Memo 2.2.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-\nemployment-policies/definitions): Definitions, Section 7.b.).\n1. Accrual of Vacation\na. \"Period of Service\" for the Purpose of Determining Vacation Accrual Rates\n\"Period of service\" for the purpose of determining vacation accrual rates means the years of service\ncounted from the employee's initial hire date as a \"regular staff employee,\" as defined in Guide\nMemo 2.2.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/definitions): Definitions. Months that count as service are:\n1. those for which some pay is received, and\n2. those following layoff when rehire occurs within 24 months.\nb. Accrual Rate Change Dates\nChanges in vacation rate accruals (both increases and decreases) are effective on the first day of\nthe employee's anniversary or status change month. The accrual change is credited in the system by\nthe last day of that month.\nc. Vacation Accrual Amounts\n(1) For Full-time Employment\nVacation leave accrues according to the following tables:\nVacation Leave Accruals, Non-exempt Staff\nQualifying Service Non-\nExempt Staff\nPer Hour on Straight Time Pay\nStatus\nApproximate Days Accrued\nper Year\nDuring first year 0.057700 15\nQualifying Service Non-\nExempt Staff\nPer Hour on Straight Time Pay\nStatus\nApproximate Days Accrued\nper Year\nBeginning year 2 through end\nof year 9 0.07693 20\nBeginning year 10 and\nthereafter 0.092310 24\nVacation Leave Accruals, Exempt Staff\nYears of ServiceExempt Staff (Do not track\nhours worked)\nHours per Calendar\nMonth\nApproximate Days per\nYear\nDuring first year 10 15\nBeginning year 2 through end of year 913.33 20\nBeginning year 10 and thereafter 16 24\n(2) For Part-time and Part-month Employment\nVacation is credited on a prorated basis for all hours in straight time pay status (not overtime) in the\nmonth credited. \"Straight time pay\" for the purpose of vacation accrual includes both straight-time\npay for work performed and pay for holidays, vacation, and sick time. (For more information, see\nGuide Memo 2.1.5 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/compensation-staff-employees): Compensation of Staff Employees.) Accrual for exempt\nemployees is prorated based on the proportion of the employee's FTE.\nd. Method of Accruing Vacation\n(1) Vacation Does Accrue\nVacation accrues from the first month of employment during non-overtime periods of work, sick time,\nand vacation. During seasonal layoff, vacation accrues as if the employee were continuing to work\nregular time. Vacation is credited at the end of each month of service.\n(2) Vacation Does Not Accrue\nNo vacation accrues during periods of leave with or without pay, including periods of short-term\ndisability, long-term disability, Workers' Compensation, or when using Family Temporary Disability\nwage replacement (FTD).\ne. Maximum Vacation Accumulation\n(1) Accrual Limits\nUnused vacation accumulates from year to year, but the maximum amount of vacation that a full-\ntime employee can accrue is 240 hours (30 work days). If an employee has accrued the maximum,\nvacation ceases to accrue. Vacation time will again accrue after the employee uses vacation time\nand the balance falls below 240 hours. The employee is not credited any vacation not earned due to\nhaving reached the 240-hour accrual maximum. New accruals will not exceed the 240-hour\nmaximum.\n(2) Accrual Limits for Part-time Employment\nThe maximum allowable accrual is prorated based on the eligible employee's FTE.\n(3) Approval for Exceptions\nAny exception to the maximum allowable accrual must be requested in writing in advance by the\nemployee's department, must identify the unique operational requirements that warrant the\nexception, and must be directed to the Vice President for Human Resources. Only the Vice\nPresident for Human Resources may grant an exception to the accrual maximum.\n(4) Change in Status\nWhen an employee's change in status from full-time to part-time results in an employee's vacation\naccumulation exceeding the employee's new maximum, the employee is paid for the excess at the\ntime of the status change unless the employee and the employee's department mutually agree upon\narrangements for the excess to be taken within a short period of time. Such arrangements can\nprovide for a combination of payment and vacation. Payment is based on the pay rate that was in\neffect immediately before the status change.\n2. Use of Vacation\na. No Advance on Vacation\nEmployees may not use vacation before it has been credited, except for borrowing up to the amount\nthe employee would normally accrue in one month to cover time that would otherwise be unpaid\nduring Winter Closure.\nb. Scheduling of Vacations\nDepartments are responsible for providing opportunities for employees to take vacations each year.\nVacation should normally be taken in the fiscal year when it is accrued. Specific arrangements are\nsubject to supervisory approval and scheduling compatible with departmental operational needs and\nshould consider the employee's preferences. If an employee has not scheduled vacation, they may\nbe required to use accrued vacation time before the close of the fiscal year in which it was accrued,\nor before the close of a grant or contract that supports the employee's salary.\nc. Reporting Vacation Time\n1. Non-Exempt Employees - Record all vacation time taken during a pay period in the human\nresources management system (HRMS).\n2. Exempt Employees - Vacation time is generally not reported in increments of less than four\nhours.

For purposes of this Guide Memo, all these types of employees\nwill be referred to as \"regular staff employee(s).\"\nFor policies that apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, refer to the\nagreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining (http://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/hr-\nprocesses-policies/labor-relations-collective-bargaining) on the Cardinal at Work website.\nProcedures for SLAC employees may vary.\n1. Accrual\na. Eligibility\nRegular staff employees of the University delineated in the Applicability section above accrue\nand use sick time as described below.\nb. Accrual of Sick Time\nRegular staff employees accrue sick time as follows:\nExempt regular staff employees accrue sick time at the rate of 8 hours per month of\nfull-time pay.\nNon-exempt regular staff employees accrue sick time at the rate of .046154 hours per\nhour of straight time. This equates to 96 hours or 12 days a year in an average year\nof 2,080 straight-time hours.\nFor part-time and part-month employment, sick time is credited on a prorated basis\nfor any month a regular staff employee receives any straight-time pay. Straight time\npay for this purpose includes both straight-time pay for work performed and pay for\nholidays, vacation, and sick. Accrual for an exempt regular staff employee who is\nemployed part-time or part-month is based on the proportion of the regular staff\nemployee with 100% FTE.\nUnused sick time accumulates from year to year, with no maximum limit.\nWhen changing positions: When a regular staff employee leaves one position and accepts\nanother position within the university, the employee retains their sick time. The employee is\nsubject to any policies applicable to the new position regarding sick time, including policies\nregarding sick time use and limits on sick time accruals. If a regular staff employee's\nacceptance of a new position results in a limit on sick time accruals due to the policy\napplicable to the new position, any sick time in excess of the limit will be returned to the\nemployee's accruals if the employee returns to a regular staff employee position consistent\nwith the service bridging timelines set out in Section 2 of Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.2\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/recruiting-and-hiring-regular-staff): Recruiting & Hiring of Regular Staff.\nNo advance: Sick time must be accrued before it can be used.\nDuring temporary layoff, sick time accrues as if the laid-off regular staff employee continued\nto work regular time. (For more information, see Section 2 of Administrative Guide Memo\n2.1.17 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/layoffs): Layoffs).\nIf a regular staff employee separates from the University in good standing and is rehired by\nthe University into a regular staff employee position within 12 months from the date of\nseparation, previously accrued and unused sick days shall be reinstated. In the case of a\nlayoff, previously accrued and unused sick days shall be reinstated if the regular staff\nemployee is rehired into a regular staff employee position within 24 months from the date of\nlayoff. (For more information about the University's policy regarding bridging of service, see\nAdministrative Guide Memo 2.1.2 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-\nresources/staff-employment-policies/recruiting-and-hiring-regular-staff): Recruiting & Hiring\nof Regular Staff.)\nSick time shall not be paid out upon separation of employment.\nA maximum of 40 hours or five scheduled workdays of protected sick time use per year,\nwhichever is greater, may be used pursuant to the California Paid Sick Leave Law enacted\nby Assembly Bill 1522 and Senate Bill 616. After this amount of sick time has been used,\nregular staff employees may use the remaining sick time pursuant to this Guide Memo\n2.1.7, and the remaining sick time is not subject to the protections of the California Paid\nSick Leave Law.\nc. No Sick Time Accrues\nNo sick time accrues during periods of leave with or without pay beginning 8/1/05 or later,\nincluding short-term disability, long-term disability, worker's compensation, and family temporary\ndisability wage replacement (FTD).\n2. Acceptable and Unacceptable Uses of Sick Time\na. Illness or Injury\nSick time may be used when a regular staff employee's illness or injury prevents the regular staff\nemployee from working.\nb. Medical and Dental Appointments\nSick time may be used for all medical and dental appointments. Medical and dental\nappointments may also be charged to vacation, PTO, or floating holiday. Medical and dental\nappointments include:\nDiagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition\nPreventive care\nAppointments associated with a work injury (e.g., physical therapy)\nc.

(For more\ninformation, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.3.5\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/employment-benefit-\nprograms/disability-and-family-leaves): Disability and Family Leaves.)\ng. Family Sick Time\n(1) Family Sick Time\nRegular staff employees may use a maximum of 15 sick days during a calendar year of service\n(January 1 to December 31) for diagnosis, care or treatment of an existing health condition of, or\npreventive care for, a regular staff employee's family member or for any purpose in accordance\nwith section 2. c. above that is for a family member. For the purpose of this policy, family member\nincludes, as the terms below are defined by law, only the regular staff employee's:\nSpouse or registered domestic partner\nChildren of the regular staff employee or spouse or registered domestic partner (including a\nbiological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child to whom the regular staff\nemployees stands in loco parentis, regardless of the child's age or dependency status\nParents and parents-in-law (including a biological, adoptive or foster parent, stepparent, or\nlegal guardian of a regular staff employee or the regular staff employee's spouse or\nregistered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the regular staff\nemployee was a minor)\nBrothers and sisters\nGrandparents or grandchildren\n(2) \nRegular staff employees may use up to 6 days out of the maximum of 15 available family sick\ndays for diagnosis, care or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a\ndesignated person, or for any purpose in accordance with section 2. c. above that is for the\ndesignated person. “Designated person” means a person identified by the regular staff employee\nat the time the regular staff employee requests paid sick days. A regular staff employee is limited\nto one “designated person” per 12-month period for such paid sick days.\n(3) \nRegular staff employees may also apply for family sick leave. (For instructions about submitting a\nfamily sick leave claim, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.3.5\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/employment-benefit-\nprograms/disability-and-family-leaves): Disability and Family Leaves.)\nh. Use of Sick Time to Maintain Pay during Disability\nUnless the regular staff employee applies to their department in writing for an exception, which is\napproved, the university uses a regular staff employee's accrued sick time to maintain the regular\nstaff employee's base pay during times when the regular staff employee is receiving disability\nbenefits payments. (For more information, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.3.5\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/employment-benefit-\nprograms/disability-and-family-leaves): Disability and Family Leaves.)\nj. Unacceptable Use of Sick Time:\nUnless otherwise specifically allowed by this Guide Memo 2.1.7, sick time may only be used for\nan absence that a regular staff employee has during scheduled work hours.\n3. Administration\na. Notification of Absence\nThe regular staff employee reports the absence (or planned absence) to the supervisor. The\ndepartment is responsible for establishing and communicating rules on how regular staff\nemployees notify the department of absences. If the need for sick time use is foreseeable, the\nregular staff employee shall provide reasonable advance notice. If the need for sick time use is\nunforeseeable, the regular staff employee shall provide notice of the need for sick time use as\nsoon as practicable. Regular staff employees may be asked to schedule appointments at a time\nconvenient for the department. Where flexible schedules are possible for the department,\nsupervisors are encouraged to accommodate appointments by flexing a regular staff employee's\nwork hours.\nb. Recording and Reporting Sick Time Accumulation and Use\nThe University uses the human resources management system (Axess/PeopleSoft HRMS) to\nrecord sick time credited, used and accumulated for all regular staff employees. Records must\nbe updated each pay period for all employees who used sick time. (For more information, see\nAdministrative Guide Memo 2.1.5 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-\nresources/staff-employment-policies/compensation-staff-employees): Compensation of Staff\nEmployees. For information about Axess see the Time & Leave System\n(http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payemployee/time_leave_reporting.html)\noverview on the Fingate website.)\nc. Sick Time Credit Date\nSick time is credited at the beginning of each month of service. An adjustment is made at the\nbeginning of the following month when the actual accrual is different than anticipated.\nd. Tax Status\nSick time is taxable income. Federal, state, and FICA taxes are deducted.\ne. Medical Confirmation\n(1) Medical Confirmation Related to Use of Sick Time\nAcceptable medical evidence may be required for the use of sick time. However, for a regular\nstaff employee's use of the first 40 hours of sick time (or five scheduled work days, whichever is\ngreater) during each year of employment, excepting circumstances involving abuse or misuse of\nsick time as stated in subpart (2) below, supervisors may not require acceptable medical\nevidence, and supervisors should not deny sick time use based on a regular staff employee's\nfailure to provide details about the sick time use. The supervisor who approves the use of sick\ntime is responsible for confirming that the conditions for the use of sick time are met. The\nUniversity may request supporting documentation for any sick leave used in excess of 40 hours\n(or five scheduled w",

The\nUniversity may request supporting documentation for any sick leave used in excess of 40 hours\n(or five scheduled work days, whichever is greater) per year of employment.\n(2) Medical Confirmation Related to Possible Abuse or Misuse of Sick Time\nIf the University has a reasonable basis to believe that a regular staff employee may have\nengaged in abuse or misuse of sick time at any time (even during the first 40 hours or five\nscheduled workdays of sick time use during each year of employment), the University may ask\nfor acceptable medical evidence or other proof showing that a regular staff employee has not\nengaged in abuse or misuse of sick time. Abuse or misuse of sick time, failure to follow sick time\nnotification procedures (e.g., failing to provide reasonable advance notice for foreseeable sick\ntime use, not providing requested medical information when abuse or misuse is suspected, or\nnot giving notice as soon as practicable for unforeseeable sick time use) may be a basis for\ndiscipline, up to and including termination of employment. Also, use of sick time may be denied if\nthere is abuse or misuse of sick time.\n(3) Acceptable Medical Evidence\nAcceptable medical evidence includes, but is not limited to, a healthcare practitioner's statement\nthat certifies a medical need for sick time, the expected duration of absence and anticipated\nreturn to work date, and any work-related limitations or restrictions (including the duration of\nthose limitations or restrictions) when a regular staff employee is released to return to work.\nf.

The university will notify you if such a situation arises.\n2. Other Absences\nNOTE: These leaves of themselves are unpaid and do not result in the employee receiving pay\nfrom the university. Depending on the nature of the leave, however, an employee may be\nrequired to use other accrued time off, e.g., accrued vacation, personal time off, or sick time,\nduring the leave or may be eligible to receive disability benefits pursuant to the terms of the\nuniversity's Voluntary Disability Insurance plan.\na. Types of Leave of Absence Without Pay\n(1) Personal Leave\nA regular employee may be placed on personal leave without pay at a department's discretion.\nExtra time off in conjunction with paid vacation or time off to take care of family circumstances\nare examples of situations that may be the basis for granting personal leave.\n(2) Disability Leave\nSee Guide Memo 2.1.7 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-\nemployment-policies/sick-time-regular-staff-employees-regular): Sick Time: Regular Staff\nEmployees, Regular Academic Staff-Research and Regular Academic Staff-Professional\nLibrarians, and Guide Memo 2.3.5 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-\nresources/employment-benefit-programs/disability-and-family-leaves): Disability and Family\nLeaves, for information relating to leaves necessitated by the employee's own injury or illness or\nthe illness of a family member.\n(3) Professional or Educational Leave\nA regular employee may be granted a leave of absence by a department to pursue activities or\neducational courses that will enhance the employee's value to the university.

(Time for participation in training, education, or professional development required and\nassigned by the department is paid work time. Refer to Guide Memo 2.1.12\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/staff-\ndevelopment-programs): Staff Development Program, for the policy regarding time off with pay to\nparticipate in staff training and development programs.)\n(4) Public Service Leave\nA department may grant a regular employee a leave of absence for temporary participation in\ncommunity, state, or national affairs, including elective public office. However, long-term or\ncontinuing full-time employment by a public or community agency normally is not a suitable basis\nfor approval of a leave of absence.\n(5) Military Service Leave\nA regular employee who voluntarily enters military service or is called for active duty for an\nextended period should contact their Human Resources Manager for more information. [For\nshort-time periods of military training duty refer to \"military training leave\" under 1.f. above; for\nleave of absence right for spouses of military personnel refer to 2.a.(6)-Other Leaves, below.]\nCertain leaves for family of members of the armed forces are outlined in Guide Memo 2.1.18\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/military-\nleave): Military Leave.\n(6) Other Leaves\nThe university provides leaves of absence as required by law, such as Volunteer Firefighters\nLeave, Parent's Leave for School Discipline, Parent's Leave for Children in School, Literacy\nLeave, time off from work for victims of a qualifying act of violence, absence from work for victims\nof crime and certain persons related to victims for judicial proceedings, and leave of absence\nright for spouses of military personnel while such personnel are on a leave from\ndeployment.

If the\ncoverage is not canceled within 31 days of the start of the leave, the employee will be billed for\ncoverage. To cancel coverage, the employee must take action; visit the Cardinal at Work website\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/my-benefits-portal/change-your-\nbenefits/employment-changes) or contact the University HR Service Team\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/contact-us?utm_source=benefits-\nrewards&utm_medium=nav-link&utm_campaign=Contact). The employee can re-enroll in\nbenefits as soon as they return to work in a benefits-eligible position.\n3. Policies for Leaves of Absence\na. Length of Leave\nEach leave of absence must be for a definite period with specific starting and ending dates. A\nleave cannot extend beyond the end of a fixed-term appointment. Whenever a proposed leave\nwill result in a total period of absence exceeding 12 months, prior approval is required from the\nlocal Human Resources Manager and the Vice President for Human Resources (or their\ndesignee), or the Director of Human Resources at SLAC. Approval of leaves exceeding 12\nmonths should be rare.\nb. Reinstatement Requirement\nA department granting or recommending a leave of absence is obligated to reinstate the\nemployee in the same or a similar position at the end of the leave. Under special circumstances,\nthe Vice President for Human Resources (or their designee) may approve a recommended leave\nwhen the employee has waived in writing the reemployment obligation. A leave of absence is not\nappropriate when the employee cannot provide reasonable assurance of intention to return to\nUniversity employment at the end of the leave.\nc. Termination of Leave by Layoff\nWhen a layoff situation occurs in a department while an employee is on a leave of absence,\nnormal layoff procedures will apply and will include the employee on leave. If a leave is\nterminated by layoff, the standard provisions for severance pay, reemployment, and benefits\ncontinuation are applicable.\nd. Failure to Return from Leave\nWhen an employee does not return to work at the end of a leave, or when a department learns\nthat an employee will not return, the department initiates a termination of the leave and of the\nindividual's employee status, citing the reason for the employee's separation.\n4. Guide to Supervisors\na. Records\nPeopleSoft/Axess should reflect both paid and unpaid absences indicating the type of leave and\nthe period of absence. Retain in the department files documentation such as evidence of\ndisability and written request for leave.\nb. Advance Approval\nWhen a leave requires advance approval from the Vice President for Human Resources (or the\nDirector of Human Resources at SLAC), the department's request for approval should include\nthe department's written recommendation.\nc. Change in Circumstances During Leave Without Pay\nWhen any change in circumstances makes it necessary to modify a leave of absence, discuss\nthe situation with the Human Resources Manager before any action is taken.\nd. Benefit Plan Arrangements\nEmployees on an unpaid leave of absence will be billed by Vita Administration Companies for\ntheir insurance and health plan premiums on an after-tax basis. Employees must pay the\npremiums promptly to Vita.\ne. Work Schedule Modifications\nSupervisors should adhere to University policies and government requirements regarding\novertime pay when modifying a nonexempt employee's work schedule to provide the employee\nwith personal time off. (See Guide Memo 2.1.5\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/compensation-staff-employees): Compensation of Staff Employees, for policies on work\nscheduling.)\nf. Procedures for Military Training Pay\nThe employee should be placed on Leave of Absence Unpaid for reason of Military Service so\nhealth and life benefits are not interrupted. When training leave ends, the employee must provide\na copy of the pay stub verifying income received from the military. The department then adjusts\nthe employee's pay for the leave period so that the adjusted salary plus military pay equals the\nusual full-time salary. (See Guide Memo 2.1.18\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/military-\nleave): Military Leave.)\ng. Reemployment Rights of Veterans\nAny employee who enters military service may have legally guaranteed reemployment rights.\nWhen an employee goes into military service, the employee's department should obtain\ninformation about these rights from Human Resources.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-\npolicies/miscellaneous-authorized-absences",

Regular Employees\nEmployees have \"regular\" status when appointed at 50% FTE or more for at least six\nconsecutive months, or as described in the applicable collective bargaining agreement. Regular\nstatus is a requirement for most health and welfare benefit plans and programs. In the\nAdministrative Guide, \"benefits-eligible\" refers to regular employees who are eligible for\nUniversity sponsored health and welfare benefits.\n9. Casual Employees\nEmployees on the University payroll appointed less than 50% FTE and work no more than 980\nhours during the calendar year for all job assignments. [Note: Departments may elect a\ndiscretionary limit of less than 980 hours based on their business need.] Once a casual\nemployee reaches the 980-hour limit, the position should be posted and filled as a regular,\nbenefits-eligible employee on the University payroll for any further work in the same calendar\nyear. An individual should not be hired or rehired into a casual position if it can reasonably be\nanticipated that the assignment will result in the employee working 980 hours or more in a\ncalendar year as a casual (or temporary) employee.\n10. Temporary Employees\nEmployees on the University payroll appointed at 50% FTE or more for no longer than six\nconsecutive months and work no more than 980 hours during the six-month period for all job\nassignments.

An individual should not be hired or rehired into a\ntemporary position if it can reasonably be anticipated that the assignment will result in the\nemployee working 980 hours or more in a calendar year as a temporary (or casual) employee.\nImportant Notes on CASUAL and TEMPORARY Employees:\na. If duties are technical, maintenance, or service, employees may be appointed at 50% FTE\nor more for no longer than four consecutive months.\nb. Temporary and casual employees are not regular employees. Temporary or casual\nemployees are considered \"at-will” for the duration of their employment. This means that\nemployment can be terminated by either the employee or the university at any time and for\nany reason, or no reason, with or without notice.\nc. An individual may be hired in a regular benefits-eligible position at any time after reaching\nthe 980-hour maximum, as long as their meets all employment requirements. Admin Guide\nMemo 2.1.2 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/2-1-2): Recruiting and Hiring of Regular Staff,\noutlines information about employment preference provided to temporary or casual staff.\nd.

Stanford\nstudents who are not currently registered are considered casual or temporary employees.\n12. Exempt Employees\nAll University employees, including students, faculty, and staff are subject to federal and state\nrequirements regarding minimum wages, payment for overtime work, and related record keeping.\nHowever, employees may be exempt from the overtime pay and record keeping requirements\nwhen they occupy bona fide professional, managerial, or executive positions. At Stanford,\n\"exempt\" positions typically include executive officers, faculty, academic staff, other teaching\nstaff, and certain professional, administrative, and executive staff. The Vice President of Human\nResources, in accordance with provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and regulations of the\nU.S. Department of Labor determines exempt status.\n13. Non-exempt Employees\nThese are the employees who are not \"exempt\" under federal and state overtime regulations.\nThey must receive compensation for overtime work.\n14. Salary Basis of Compensation\nA \"salary,\" as distinguished from an \"hourly wage\" is compensation established by the month\n(e.g. $1,000 per month) with the amount remaining the same each month without regard to the\nvariations from month to month in the normal number of working hours (e.g., in 2010 a salaried\nfull-time employee received the same salary for January with 184 working hours and for\nFebruary with 160 working hours.)\n15. Hourly Basis of Compensation\nCompensation established on an hourly basis, so that pay varies with the actual number of hours\nworked (or on paid leave) in each pay period.\n16. Pay Period\nEach month has two pay periods: The first day of the month through the 15th and the 16th\nthrough the last day of the month. Paychecks are issued on the workday that falls on or\nimmediately prior to the seventh calendar day after the end of each pay period.\n17. Staff Benefits\nPlans and programs made available by the University for the benefit of faculty and staff.

    "text": "2.2.10 Gifts and Awards for University\nEmployees\nAuthority\nThis Guide Memo was jointly approved by the Vice President for Human Resources and the\nSenior Associate Vice President for Finance.\nLast Updated\nJuly 20, 2023\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 23.8\nThis Guide Memo provides specific guidelines for occasional gifts, awards, and prizes to\nuniversity employees in compliance with federal and state regulations. The cognizant vice\npresident, vice provost, dean, or designee should establish guidelines to ensure consistent\napplication of this policy across their business unit. This policy is based on and in alignment with\nthe expectations set forth by AGM 1.1.1: University Code of Conduct, specifically regarding\nemploying sound business practices and exercising prudent financial management in the\nstewardship of university resources.\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to all faculty, academic staff, and regular staff as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/definitions): Definitions.\n1. Policy Statement\nSchools, departments, and other organizational units (business units) may use appropriate\nuniversity funding (https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/fund-types) sources to\noccasionally provide gifts, awards, or prizes to university employees to recognize non-\nperformance-related activities. See Cardinal at Work\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/working-stanford/recognition/performance-recognition) for\ninformation on performance recognition. Each business unit decides who is eligible and what\noccasion warrants a gift. The cognizant vice president, vice provost, dean, or designee should\nestablish guidelines to ensure consistent application of this policy across their business unit.\nGifts may not be presented in place of payment for services. All gifts, awards, or prizes given to\nuniversity employees are taxable income to the employee except for the following, and then only\nwhen given within the parameters detailed in the subsequent sections:\nTangible length of service/retirement awards\n‘De Minimis’ tangible gifts, awards, prizes, and sympathy gifts as defined in Section 3\nCash or cash equivalent items, which include all gift cards and gift certificates, are always\ntaxable to the recipient regardless of the amount as required by IRS regulations.\n2. Tangible Length of Service/Retirement Awards\nA regular staff employee and an academic staff employee must be in active service on their\nanniversary date to receive the length-of-service award. Length of service is determined by\ncomputing the period of service as defined in Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/node/647), Section 1.a. The value of the award should be\nproportionate to the number of years of service recognized (e.g., a 15-year service award is\ngreater than the 10-year service award). Recognition should be made in five-year increments. \nTo commemorate length of service or retirement, an item or items of tangible personal property\nwith a total value up to $400 can be given on a tax-free basis to an employee with at least five\nyears of service. The value or cost of the length of service or retirement award should not exceed\n$400 during the taxable (calendar) year. Stanford-branded merchandise or other tangible items,\nincluding food, are recommended. Any gifts of cash or cash equivalents, gift cards, or gift\ncertificates are taxable to the employee regardless of the amount. Learn more about employee\ngifts on Fingate’s Categories of Purchases (https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-\ncontracts/categories-purchases).\nThe value of the award should be proportionate to the number of years of service recognized\n(e.g., a 15-year service award is greater than the 10-year service award). The award must be\npresented in a meaningful presentation or ceremony. Every attempt should be made to give a\nlength of service/retirement award during the year the anniversary occurs. Business units must\nensure that special presentation events are conducted only on an occasional basis and that the\ncosts of these events are reasonable. Recognition should be made in five-year increments.\nIf the employee elects to retire the same year they become eligible for a length-of-service award,\nthen the maximum total value or cost of the award(s) should not exceed $400 for the award(s) to\nbe nontaxable. \nThe guidelines above also apply to faculty retirement awards. Faculty members do not\nparticipate in the five-year incremental length of service awards or the Stanford Celebrates You\nprogram.\nLength of service or retirement awards with a value over $400 will be taxable to the extent the\nvalue exceeds the dollar limit (e.g., if a $450 award is given, then $50 will be taxable).\n3. ‘De Minimis’ Tangible Gifts, Awards, Prizes, and\nSympathy Gifts\na. Gifts, Awards, and Prizes\nTangible items of personal property given to an employee as a gift, award or prize should not\nexceed an aggregate value over the course of a calendar year of more than $100 per individual.\nGifts, awards, or prizes that are provided frequently to an employee, even in small amounts, are\nnot considered de minimis. Stanford-branded merchandise or other tangible items, including\nfood, are recommended. Any gifts of cash or cash equivalents, gift cards, or gift certificates are\ntaxable to the employee regardless of the amount.\nDonated prizes or gifts used for a raffle drawing or door prize at an employee event must comply\nwith the $100 per individual limit for the prize to be non-taxable to the employee.\nGifts with an aggregate value over $100 will be fully taxable (e.g., if several gifts which total to\n$150 are given over the course of a calendar year, then $150 will be taxable).\nb. Sympathy Gifts\nTangible items of personal property, such as flowers or fruit baskets, may be given to an\nemployee to express sympathy when there is a death or serious illness of the employee’s close\nfamily member. The value of the gift should not exceed an aggregate value of $100. Any gifts of\ncash or cash equivalents, gift cards, or gift certificates are taxable to the employee regardless of\nthe amount.\n4. Requesting Payment and Recording Value\nThe value of a gift, award, or prize may be paid personally and reimbursed by the university or\npurchased using a university Purchasing Card.\na. Non-taxable Gifts, Awards, and Prizes\nThe employee’s name and the occasion for the gift (e.g., 10-year service) must be included in\nthe transaction. \nb. Taxable Gifts, Awards, and Prizes\nThe employee’s name, employee ID number, and occasion for the gift must be included in the\ntransaction to allow for the value to be tax reported to the employee on their Form W-2.\n5. Employee Morale and Performance-based Awards\nThis policy does not discuss ordinary business expenses in the promotion of employee morale.\nExamples of such business expenses are occasional business lunches or office gatherings. For\nmore information, see Administrative Guide Memo 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses.\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/travel-and-business-\nexpenses/business-and-travel-expenses)\nThis policy does not discuss performance-based awards or bonuses, which are taxable to the\nrecipient and processed through Payroll (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-\nresources/general-employment-policies/university-payroll).\n6.

    "text": "2.2.2 Out-of-State Employees\nAuthority\nThis Guide Memo was approved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial\nOfficer.\nLast Updated\nDecember 14, 2012\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 2.2.12, 23.11\nThis Guide Memo presents policy for hiring and/or reassigning out-of-state employees.\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to all Stanford University employees, including SLAC and employees covered\nby collective bargaining unit agreements.\n1. Definition\nAn \"out-of-state employee\" is defined as an employee of Stanford University whose primary work\nsite is located outside the state of California. All individuals defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/definitions): Definitions, are considered employees for the purpose of this Guide Memo.\nConsultants and contractors are not covered by this Memo.\n2. Policy\na. Applicable laws\nEmployees outside the state of California and Stanford University as their employer are subject\nto all employment-related laws of the state or foreign nation in which they work.\nState taxes, employment tax, and workers compensation provisions vary from state to state.\nUniversity Payroll is primarily responsible for compliance with these various rules. Therefore,\ndepartments must notify Payroll immediately of any prospective arrangements involving Stanford\nemployees outside the state of California by submitting a HelpSU\n(http://helpsu.stanford.edu)ticket (Category: Financial Management, Request Type: Payroll).\nThe existence of Stanford University employees in a state outside California may trigger\nadditional compliance requirements besides those relating to employment. Therefore, the hiring\nor reassignment of employees to positions outside California must be supported by an important\nUniversity business purpose and not be merely an accommodation to the employee.\nb. Approval\nApproval of the hire or reassignment must be obtained in advance in writing from the responsible\nVice Provost, Vice President (or similar level equivalent to the highest administrative person\nwithin the organizational unit), or their designee, identifying the key University business reasons\nfor the assignment.\nc. Payroll\nNotify University Payroll of the out-of-state assignment in advance of the start of work outside of\nCalifornia by sending a completed Approval of Out-of-State Employee Approval form\n(http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/docs/approval_out_state_hire.pdf)to the Payroll\nOffice.\nd. Administrative costs\nAdministrative costs per capita for out-of-state employees are high due to the extraordinary costs\nto assure compliance and, in some cases, liability for unemployment and disability benefits.\nTherefore, a one-time $500 fee is charged to the assigning department for each new out-of-state\nemployee on payroll, to be assessed when the assignment begins. Departments are also\ncharged $200 each year for each out-of-state employee. Failure to report out-of-state employees\nto University Payroll in a timely manner may result in compliance penalties, which will be\nassessed to the assigning department.\ne. Benefits\nThe choices of health and welfare benefits plans may be more limited for employees who work\noutside of the Bay Area. You can find more information at\nhttps://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards).\nf. When Employee Works in California\nNotify University Payroll of any days that the out-of state employee is present in California on\nStanford business. Compensation earned on such days is considered California-sourced taxable\nincome regardless of employee’s state of residence and is subject to all California tax provisions.\nUse the Report of Days Worked in California for Out-Of-State Employees form\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/paying-people/form/report-days-worked-california-out-state-\nemployees) to report annually the number of days an out-of-state worker works in California.\n3. For More Information\nContact University Payroll by submitting a HelpSU (http://helpsu.stanford.edu) ticket (Category:\nFinancial Management, Request Type: Payroll).\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/out-state-employees",

    "text": "2.2.3 University Payroll\nAuthority\nApproved by the Senior Associate Vice President for Finance.\nLast Updated\nAugust 15, 2023\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 35\nThis Guide Memo contains general policies concerning the university payroll. SLAC National\nAccelerator Laboratory (SLAC) currently applies the applicable policies contained herein. SLAC\ndepartments should consult SLAC Business Services Division for SLAC procedures.\n1. Employer/Employee Relationship\nWhether an individual is a university employee or an independent contractor is a determination\nwith important practical and legal consequences.\na. Definitions of Employee and Independent Contractor/Consultant\nFederal tax rules define an employee as an individual who performs services subject to control by\nan employer both as to what services shall be performed and how they shall be performed. If the\nuniversity has the legal right to control both the method and result of services, that person is\nconsidered an employee and therefore subject to income tax withholding. By contrast, for\nindependent contractors (sometimes called consultants), the university does not control where and\nhow the work is performed but only receives a final deliverable. Independent contractors or\nconsulting firms should be procured through the procurement contract process\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/contracts) on the Fingate website. For more\ninformation, refer to IRS guidance at Employee or Independent Contractor Status\n(https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-\nemployed-or-employee). If the person and/or work being performed do not legally qualify for\nIndependent Contractor status, hiring the person as a contingent worker may be the appropriate\noption.\n2. Employment Categories\nEmployees are categorized within the payroll system according to the length of the appointment,\nthe percentage of time worked, and the type of position they fill. These categories in combination\naffect eligibility for most employment benefits.\na. Length of Appointment\n(1) Continuing\nContinuing employees are expected to remain on the payroll for six months or more (four months\nor more for Bargaining Unit employees).\n(2) Temporary\nTemporary employees are expected to remain on the payroll for less than six months (less than\nfour months for Bargaining Unit employees). Stanford students working less than 50% time may be\nappointed for the entire academic year as temporary employees. Temporary employees are not\neligible for employment benefits.\nb. Scope of Appointment\nThe percentage of a full-time equivalent position (% FTE) an employee works affects both eligibility\nand level of benefits. See Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/definitions) for the % FTE of a continuing appointment that grants \"regular employee\"\nstatus and eligibility for most benefit plans and programs.\nc. Type of Position\nThe job classification defines whether the position is:\n(1) Salaried or Hourly-Paid\nSalaried employees are paid their semi-monthly salary (less authorized deductions) every\npay period unless an exception (such as authorized overtime hours or leave without pay) is\nreported. Subject to exceptions, the gross salary amount of the paycheck is the same for\neach pay period, regardless of the number of working days in the period.\nHourly-paid employees are paid for actual hours worked (less authorized deductions) as\nshown on a timecard submitted for the pay period.\n(2) Exempt or Non-exempt\nSee the definitions in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/definitions). Employees who are exempt from the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards\nAct are not paid overtime.\n3. Compliance with Employment Law\na. Documentation of Eligibility for Employment\n(1) Completing Form I-9\nAll new and rehired employees must complete a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\n(USCIS) Form I-9 by the end of the day on their first day of (re)employment, and provide\nappropriate original document(s) to establish identity and work authorization. The hiring\ndepartment, or other university designee, must review the original document(s) and complete the\nemployer portion of this form within three business days of the first day of employment. Employers\ncannot specify which document(s) the employee must present. Completed forms are submitted to\nPayroll for review and document retention.\n(2) Updating Form I-9\nEligibility to work in the U.S. may expire for certain types of temporary visitors. Documentation of\ncontinued eligibility to work must be provided before the work eligibility expiration date.\n(3) Re-verifying Form I-9\nA new or re-verified Form I-9 must be completed after any break in employment. Certain\nexceptions apply for instructional staff/faculty, student, or seasonal/temporary employees returning\nto the same job in the same department following an expected break in employment of less than\none year. See Topic Overview: Verify Eligibility for Employment and Form I-9\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/paying-people/verify-eligibility-employment-i-9) on the Fingate website\nfor detailed guidelines. \n(4) Failure to Complete/Update Form I-9\nFailure to comply with USCIS Form I-9 requirements will result in ineligibility for employment\nand/or immediate termination.\nb. Tax Requirements\n(1) Withholding Tax Information\nNew employees must complete a withholding declaration at hire. In the absence of a completed\nwithholding declaration, withholding tax will be applied as if the employee had claimed \"Single\"\nstatus with no withholding allowances on their W-4 and DE-4.\n(2) Tax Treaties\nSome employees who are not residents of the U.S. may qualify for full or partial exemption from\nwithholding tax based on tax treaties between the U.S. and their country of tax residence. Texts of\nmost treaties (in both English and the language of the other country) are available from the IRS\nwebsite (http://irs.gov). For more information and to obtain the necessary documents to claim a tax\ntreaty, see How to: Claim Tax Treaty for Salary Payments\n(http://fingate.stanford.edu/students/taxinfo/quick_steps/claim_taxTreaty_salary.html) on the\nFingate website.\n(3) Social Security Number\nA Social Security number is required for all employees working in the U.S. Employees who do not\nalready have a Social Security number may begin employment, but must immediately apply for\none and obtain a receipt of application. Once received, the hiring department must enter the\nemployee's Social Security number in the university's human resource management system.\n4. Payroll Accounting\na. Semi-Monthly Payroll\nUniversity employees are paid semimonthly. Pay periods are the 1st through 15th and the 16th\nthrough the last day of the month. See Payroll Schedules and Deadlines\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/paying-people/resource/payroll-schedules-and-deadlines) on the\nFingate website.\nb. Salary Approvals\nDepartment heads or other authorized university officers approve charges of salaries and wages to\ntheir projects, tasks and awards (PTAs) in accordance with budgets, compensation policies, and\ncollective bargaining agreements. In addition to the department head, certain offices have\nresponsibility for reviewing salaries and wages for specific categories of employees. Salary\nchanges, supplementary compensation, salary during leave of absence, and termination of salary\nrequire the same authorization and review. Supervisors (or, in their absence, designees with first-\nhand knowledge of employees work hours) are responsible for approving employees' timecards,\nincluding leave usage for exempt and non-exempt employees and work hours for non-exempt\nemployees.\nFaculty and Academic Staff: Salaries for faculty and academic staff are reviewed and\napproved by the cognizant dean and the Provost's Office.\nSalaried Staff: Salaries for staff employees are estab",

In some cases, review by Human\nResources is also required.\nHourly-paid Staff: Hourly wages are reviewed and approved by Human Resources.\nStudents: See Undergraduate Student Wage Scales\n(https://financialaid.stanford.edu/faculty_staff/undergrad/wage_scale.html), Guide Memo\n10.2.1: Graduate Student Assistantships (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-\nemployment-and-assistantships/graduate-student-employment-campus/graduate-student),\nand the Graduate Student Assistantship Supplement\n(https://gfs.stanford.edu/salary/salary18/index.html).\nc. Charges to Projects, Tasks and Awards\nFinancial Management Services (FMS) charges salary and wage expenditures to PTAs designated\nby the department through Labor Schedules. Oracle Business Intelligence (OBI) reporting provides\ninformation about charging salary through a number of monthly expenditure reports\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/reporting/obi-dashboard-consolidated-expenditure-\nreporting-dashboard-and-reports-cer). The Consolidated Expenditure Reporting dashboard\nfocuses on the PTAs where salary has already been charged. The Payroll and Labor Management\ndashboard focuses more on the individual employee. See the Fingate website for the training\ninformation and requirements (https://fingate.stanford.edu/authority/learning/fin-prog-0020-\nfinancial-stewardship-expectations) that must be completed to access Labor Schedules.\n(1) Multiple Activities/Accounts\nIf an employee is paid from more than one PTA, the authorized portion of salary or wage is\nallocated to the appropriate PTA. The paycheck or bank deposit advice delivered to the employee\ncombines all earnings into one check.\n(2) Organization Suspense Account\nEach department designates an unrestricted PTA as an Organization Suspense Account to which\nsalaries of department employees are charged whenever the source of salary funding (such as a\ngrant or contract) runs out and is not immediately replaced by alternative funding. Charges to\nOrganization Suspense Account PTAs, which are charged to the expenditure type 51610, should\nbe reviewed on a timely basis to determine if transfers are needed. See Guide Memo 3.2.2: Cost\nTransfers (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/expenditure-\nmanagement/cost-transfers).\n5. Taxes on Salaries and Wages\na. Taxable Earnings\nThe university withholds Federal, State, and other applicable taxes from all taxable earnings paid\nto employees. Taxable earnings include regular pay, overtime pay, supplementary compensation,\nand any additional and miscellaneous payments for work performed for the university. This may\nalso include taxable reimbursements. See Guide Memo 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/business-and-travel-\nexpenses/business-and-travel-expenses) for additional details on taxable reimbursements.\nb. W-2 Statements\nAt the end of each tax year (January 1 through December 31), Stanford compiles and distributes a\nW-2 statement for each employee. By default, W-2 statements are mailed to the employee's\nmailing address on file with the university. Employees may elect to have their W-2 statement sent\nto them electronically in the Axess portal. The university also sends Form W-2 data, as required, to\nFederal and State governments.\nc. Tax Exemptions\nEmployees may not claim more withholding allowances than those allowed by the Internal\nRevenue Service or Franchise Tax Board. Fewer allowances may be claimed or additional dollar\namount of taxes may be withheld if an employee wishes to increase the amount of tax withheld.\nInformation about completing the IRS W-4 form and Franchise Tax Board form DE-4, used to\nspecify withholding allowances, is located on the Fingate website at How to: Declare or Change\nWithholding Allowances\n(http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/payemployee/quick_steps/declare_withholding_allowance.html). \nd. Student Employees\nStudents who take jobs with the university while pursuing their studies are paid through the\nuniversity payroll. Degree-seeking Stanford student employees, who are employed while enrolled\nin classes, do not pay Social Security taxes or Disability Insurance.\ne. Scholarships and Fellowships\nScholarship and fellowship payments are not considered payments for work performed and the\nrecipients are not placed in an employer-employee relationship because of receipt of this money\nfrom the university.\nf. Research and Teaching Assistants\nResearch and teaching assistantships are taxable and tax is withheld from the semi-monthly\nsalary.\ng. Non-California Residents\nEmployees who physically work in California are treated as California residents for California tax\npurposes.\nh. Tax Status of Non-U.S. Residents\nSalaries and wages paid to non-residents of the U.S. fall under the tax laws of the United States\nand the state of California. The specific provisions of the tax laws, treaties, conventions, and\ndeterminations in regard to non-residents are handled by the IRS and the California Franchise Tax\nBoard.\n6. Payroll Deductions\na. Deductions for Benefits\nEmployees eligible for benefits (e.g., regular staff, faculty) may pay the employee's share of the\ncost of some insurance programs and benefits by payroll deduction. For more information, go to\nthe Cardinal at Work website (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/health).\nb. Other Authorized Deduction\nThe university has authorized voluntary payroll deductions for payments to certain organizations\n(such as the Stanford Faculty Club). Any employee who wishes to use this procedure should make\narrangements directly with the organization for which the deduction is authorized. That\norganization will send the authorization to Payroll.\nc. Reporting Deductions\nDeductions from each paycheck are itemized on the pay statement. The amounts deducted are\nsent to the designated organizations.\nd. Cessation of Deductions\n(1) Benefits\nPayroll deductions for benefits cease during leaves of absence without pay. An employee on leave\nwithout pay will receive information from the university's leave administrator on how to pay for the\nemployee's share of the costs for applicable insurance plans. Benefit deductions also stop when\nan employee's status changes to a non-benefits-eligible position (see Guide Memo\n2.2.1: Definitions (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-\nemployment-policies/definitions)) and when employment terminates. At that time, terminated\nemployees with retirement savings plans should review the available distribution options on the\nCardinal at Work (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/saving-retirement) website.\n(2) Other Authorized Deductions\nSuch deductions cease during leaves of absence without pay, at termination of employment, or on\nretirement.\n7. Delivery of Checks and Bank Deposit Advices\na. Direct Deposit of Paychecks\nEmployees are encouraged to have their paychecks deposited directly into their bank accounts.\nEmployees may use any bank, savings and loan or credit union that is a member of the Automated\nClearing House and can accept electronic fund transfers. Direct deposit enrollment instructions are\navailable at How to: Enroll/Update/Cancel Direct Deposit\n(http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payemployee/quick_steps/enroll_direct_deposit.html)\non the Fingate website.\nb. Delivery of Semi-monthly Paychecks\nPay statements are provided for all employees electronically in the Axess portal. Payroll distributes\nlive paychecks to the mailing address on file.

Employees who wish to receive a paper pay statement must select this\noption in the Axess portal.\nc. Undelivered Checks\nPayroll will reach out to the department and/or the employee for checks returned by the Post Office\nin an effort to re-mail the checks to the employee. Paychecks issued in error must be returned to\nPayroll for cancellation and reversal of earnings from the employee's W-2.\nd. Stale-Dated Checks\nPaychecks are negotiable for six months from date of issue. Stale-dated checks should be\nreturned to Payroll for reissue. Funds from checks not cashed after one year from date of issue are\nremitted to the Unclaimed Property Bureau.\ne. Delivery of Final Paycheck\nAn individual's final paycheck must include the total amount of salary or wages owed as of the\ndate of termination. This includes all payments due, including accumulated, unused vacation\nleave, PTO and floating holiday, less authorized deductions. The department should contact\nEmployee & Labor Relations in advance if questions arise.\n1. If the university initiates the termination, or if the employee initiates the termination and gives\nat least 72 hours notice, the final paycheck must be given to the employee on the date of\ntermination.\n2. When an employee initiates the termination and gives less than 72 hours notice, the final\npaycheck is due to the employee within 72 hours after termination. Departments are\nresponsible for making sure final paychecks are delivered to employees under the time\nlimitations provided by law. A completed termination transaction\n(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XJePZhpRqGLaJ3cw4oXcP7vv4DYjmLTm) must be\nsubmitted to Payroll in order to process the final paycheck. \n8. Salary and Wage Calculations\na. Vacation Payment and Vacation Credit\nVacation earned but unused at termination is paid on the basis of the employee’s hourly rate at\ntermination. For salaried employees at 100% FTE, the hourly rate is calculated by dividing the\nannual salary by 2080 (hours in a working year). If an employee leaves one position and accepts\nanother position within the university, the employee retains their accumulated vacation accruals.\n(See Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-\nresources/staff-employment-policies/vacations)). The vacation accrual template found at How to:\nCalculate Vacation Accrual\n(http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payadmin/quick_steps/calcuate_vac_accrual.html)on\nthe Fingate website and can be used to calculate vacation when an employee terminates.\nb. Partial Pay Period Pay Calculation\nPay for less than a full pay period for new or terminating salaried employees is calculated by\ndividing the annual salary by 2080 (hours in a working year) and multiplying that number by the\nnumber of days the employee actually worked, including adjacent holidays, in the pay period\nmultiplied by eight (assume eight hours/day for a full-time exempt employee.) Holidays are\ncounted as workdays when the employee works or is on paid leave (including vacation), both the\nday immediately preceding and the day following a holiday.\n9. Special Situations\na. Salary Advances\nUnder certain circumstances as described below, salary advances are available to regular staff\nemployees who are not in bargaining units. (Find information on salary advances for Bargaining\nUnit members in the applicable agreement.)\n(1) Vacation Advance\nAn employee scheduled to take vacation leave of at least 10 consecutive workdays outside the\nSan Francisco Bay Area, may request early payment of any regular paychecks that would be\nissued during that period.\n(2) Emergency Advance\nOnly in an emergency and with the concurrence of their department, a regular employee may\nreceive an advance of salary already earned in one pay period prior to the regular payday for that\npay period. No more than two emergency advances for the same employee will be processed in a\n12-month period.\nb. Faculty Terminations\nA faculty member leaving after completing the employment obligation but before the designated\nend date of their appointment may receive the balance of salary through a special processing\nprocedure. If this option is exercised, the faculty member's status as an employee ends on the\ntermination date. The termination date must not be later than the date of the final check.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/university-payroll",

    "text": "2.2.5 Requesting a Lactation\nAccommodation\nAuthority\nVice President for Human Resources\nLast Updated\nJuly 10, 2023\nApplicability: This policy applies to all faculty, academic staff, other teaching staff, and staff\nemployees.\nStudents and postdoctoral scholars with questions about lactation accommodations may contact\nthe Title IX Office at titleix@stanford.edu (mailto:titleix@stanford.edu) or 650-497-4955.\n1. Policy Summary\nStanford University supports the importance of health and bonding for parents nursing their\ninfants. It is the policy of the university to follow all state and federal laws and regulations in this\narea, including California Labor Code (Sections 1030-1033), Patient Protection and Affordable\nCare Act (PPACA), and Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act.\nIn promoting a family-friendly work environment and to ensure equality of access for employees\nwho wish to breastfeed, the university will provide reasonable accommodations to enable\nemployees to express breast milk.\nLactation spaces are available to all members of the university community, including students,\npostdoctoral scholars, and third parties who participate in Stanford programs and activities. The\nWorkLife Office (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/worklife) maintains a list of\ncampus spaces that may be used for lactation.\nAll Stanford University affiliated nursing parents, including students and postdoctoral scholars,\nare encouraged to register for the Stanford Lactation Support Program\n(https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3UWeounCEm48bxH). Additional resources\nfor lactation support information and educational resources are available on Cardinal at Work\nat: worklife.stanford.edu (https://worklife.stanford.edu). \n2. Implementation and Responsibility\na. Employees:\nare responsible for notifying a supervisor as soon as a lactation accommodation is needed. It is\nrecommended that an employee anticipating an accommodation discuss their needs with their\nsupervisor before a family leave is taken, including the anticipated schedule and request to\naccess an appropriate space. Requests from staff employees should be made to the supervisor\nor Human Resources Manager. Faculty, academic staff and other teaching staff should contact\ntheir Department Chair and departmental faculty affairs officer.\nb. Supervisors:\nare responsible for receiving requests for a lactation accommodation, and in consultation with the\nHuman Resources Manager, reviewing accommodation requirements, identifying appropriate\nspace and schedule for the employee, and discussing the accommodation with the employee. In\nthe case of faculty, academic staff and other teaching staff, the term ‘supervisor’ in this policy\nrefers to the Department Chair.\nc. Human Resources Managers:\nare responsible for advising supervisors of accommodation requirements and assisting\nsupervisors in consultation with the building or facilities managers to identify appropriate space to\naccommodate the employee. To identify the local Human Resources office, call the appropriate\nnumber: Campus 650-721-4272; School of Medicine 650-497-2750; SLAC 650-926-2358.\nd. Department Chairs and Departmental Faculty Affairs Officers:\nare responsible for receiving faculty, academic staff and other teaching staff requests for a\nlactation accommodation and, in consultation with the Human Resources Manager or\ndepartmental faculty affairs officer, reviewing accommodation requests and requirements,\nidentifying appropriate space for the employee and discussing the accommodation with the\nemployee.\n3. Process - Recommended Steps\na. Step One – Request\nEmployees are responsible for initiating the request for a lactation accommodation. The request\ndoes not need to be made in writing, nor is a doctor’s note required. The employee should\nconsider discussing a request with their supervisor or Human Resources Manager before taking\na family leave.\nb. Step Two – Discussion\nWhen received, the supervisor or Human Resources Manager will meet with the employee to\nacknowledge the request and help develop an accommodation. The supervisor or Human\nResources Manager should confirm that the employee has a private, clean and secure place to\nexpress breastmilk (see Section 5: Identifying Space). If the employee has questions or concerns\nabout expressing breastmilk at work, questions should be referred to the Human Resources\nManager or the WorkLife Office.\nc. Step Three – Follow up\nThe supervisor or Human Resources Manager should confirm the accommodation in writing and\noffer to revisit the plan with the employee after two to three weeks to see if any changes are\nneeded. \n4. Accommodation Periods\nAn accommodation includes a reasonable amount of time taken as needed by the employee to\nexpress breastmilk in a space that complies with state and federal requirements (see Section 5:\nIdentifying Space). When possible, time should be taken during regularly scheduled meal and\nrest periods. The number of breaks needed to express breastmilk may vary. A nursing parent will\ntypically need two or three breaks during an eight-hour period; however, additional break times\nmay be necessary. If the time to express breastmilk exceeds an employee’s regularly-scheduled\nmeal or rest periods, non-exempt employees may request to be provided an opportunity to make\nup time per Admin Guide Memo 2.1.5 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-\nresources/staff-employment-policies/compensation-staff-employees). If no reasonable\nopportunity exists for a non-exempt employee to make up time, the time to express breastmilk\nthat exceeds paid rest periods will not be paid. \nIf an employee, who is otherwise entitled to rest breaks or meal periods under Guide Memo\n2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-\nresources/staff-employment-policies/compensation-staff-employees), Sections 2.e-f, is not\nprovided reasonable break time or adequate space to express milk, a penalty of one hour of the\nemployee's straight time hourly rate must be paid to the employee each day there is such a\nviolation. Any employee who believes they have not been provided with reasonable break time or\nadequate space to express milk should immediately report their concerns to their local Human\nResources office or University Human Resources-Employee & Labor Relations. Employees may\nalso pursue complaints directly with the California Labor Commissioner's Office.\n5. Identifying Space\nAppropriate space that complies with state and federal requirements includes any space that can\nbe made private, shielded from view and free from intrusions from coworkers or the public, and is\nnot located in a bathroom. Appropriate space can include a private office, a conference room\nwith a locking door, or any other compliant space that can be secured and shielded from view.\nAppropriate space must include all of the following requirements:\nBe safe, clean and free of hazardous materials;\nContain a surface to place a breast pump and personal items;\nContain a place to sit; and\nHave access to electricity or alternative devices, including, but not limited to, extension\ncords or charging stations needed to operate an electric or battery-powered breast pump.\nThe employee must be provided access to a sink with running water and a refrigerator suitable\nfor storing milk in close proximity to the employee's workspace.\n6. Employee's Own or Adjacent Building\nEvery effort should be made to identify space in the employee’s building when possible. It may\nbe necessary to identify more than one space in order to meet the needs of both the employee\nand department. Space may be identified at an adjacent building within a reasonable walking\ndistance and that is accessible to the employee during the arranged lactation schedule. A\nreasonable distance is recommended as no more than a 5-minute walk from the employee’s\nbuilding. For multi-use spaces, the use of the room for lactation will take pr",

    "text": "2.2.7 Requesting Workplace\nAccommodations For Employees With\nDisabilities\nAuthority\nApproved by the President.\nLast Updated\nJanuary 17, 2023\nEffective Date\nJanuary 17, 2023\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 23.5\nThis Guide Memo outlines Stanford University's policies and procedures for employee requests\nfor disability-related accommodations.\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to all University employees.\n1. Policy\nStanford University values diversity and is committed to providing equal employment\nopportunities to all qualified employees, including those with disabilities. The University follows\nall state and federal laws and regulations, including the California Fair Employment and Housing\nAct (CFEHA), the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504). Disability is defined as any physical or mental\nimpairment that limits one or more of an individual's major life activities (e.g., caring for oneself,\nwalking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, sitting, standing). To ensure equality of\naccess for employees with disabilities, the University will provide reasonable accommodations\nand auxiliary aids to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of their job and\nparticipate in University programs and activities.\n2. Implementation and Responsibility\na. Employees\nEmployees are responsible for initiating requests and cooperating in the interactive process for\nany desired disability-related workplace accommodations. Requests by non-faculty employees\nshould go to the supervisor or human resources manager; faculty employees should contact their\nChair, departmental or school faculty affairs officer, or the ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer.\nb. Supervisors\nSupervisors are responsible for receiving requests for workplace accommodations, informing\nemployees of the process, and referring requests to the appropriate human resources manager.\nSupervisors, in coordination with their local human resources manager, are responsible for\ninitiating a discussion concerning accommodations when they have reason to believe an\nemployee's disability precludes the employee from initiating a request. Supervisors will promptly\ninform the local human resources manager of all requests and accommodations.\nc. Human Resources Managers\nHuman Resources Managers are responsible for evaluating the request, determining what type\nof documentation is necessary, and determining if the requested accommodation is appropriate\nand effective. To identify your human resources manager, see the human resources managers\nlist (https://hr.stanford.edu/organization/hr-business-partners).\nd. ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer\nThe ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer provides information on the employment provisions of\nthe ADA and employer obligations. You can also contact the Compliance Officer for information\non campus accessibility, how to get technical and assistive equipment, and funding sources. You\ncan reach the ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer at the Diversity & Access Office located in\nKingscote Gardens, 419 Lagunita Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, (650) 725-0326, FAX (650) 723-\n1791, TTY (650) 723-1216.\ne. Chairs and Faculty Affairs Officers\nChairs and Faculty Affairs Officers are responsible for receiving requests for workplace\naccommodations and referring requests to the ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer for handling\nunder procedures similar to Section 3.\n3. Process\na. Step One - Request\nThe employee is responsible for requesting a workplace accommodation for their disability. The\nrequest shall be made to either the employee's supervisor or the local human resources\nmanager. Requests should be in writing and include:\nEmployee's name, telephone number, and address\nDepartment\nSupervisor\nLimitations caused by the medical condition or disability (not the underlying medical\ndiagnosis)\nWhat accommodation is being requested\nBrief explanation of how the requested accommodation will enable the employee to\nperform the essential functions of their job.\nb. Step Two - Discussion\nWhen received, the supervisor and/or human resources manager will meet with the employee to\nacknowledge the request and explain the process. The supervisor or human resources manager\nwill also meet with the employee as necessary to discuss the request and accommodation\nalternatives.\nc. Step Three - Providing Necessary Documentation\nThe supervisor and/or human resources manager evaluating the requested accommodation will\ndetermine what type of documentation is necessary to proceed with the process. This may vary\ndepending on the particular circumstances and the accommodation requested. It is the\nemployee's responsibility to provide the requested documentation supporting the request for\naccommodation. If the University determines it is appropriate to get a second professional\nopinion concerning the nature or impact of a physical or mental disability, the Department will\nbear the cost of the second opinion. Any request for a second opinion must be coordinated with\nUniversity Human Resources--Employee & Labor Relations. The request for an accommodation\nwill be evaluated once the employee submits all documentation to the human resources\nmanager and/or the supervisor.\nd. Step Four - Evaluation\nAppropriate accommodations are determined following an individualized assessment of each\nrequest. The supervisor and/or human resources manager will consider the needs and requests\nfor reasonable accommodation to determine whether the necessary equipment or services exist\nalready in a different department or unit before investing in new equipment or additional services.\nAmong the factors considered in determining reasonable accommodations for employees are:\n1. Does the employee's physical or mental condition limit one or more major life activities?\n2. How does the limitation(s) affect the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions of\nthe job?\n3. Will the requested accommodation allow the employee to perform the essential\njob functions effectively?\n4. Will the requested accommodation alter or remove an essential function of the job?\n5. What impact will the requested accommodation or modification have on the department or\nunit?\nThe University is not required to provide an accommodation that will eliminate an essential\nfunction of the job in question or to provide an accommodation or service that is personal in\nnature, such as a hearing aid or wheelchair. Furthermore, the University is not required to lower\nperformance, production or conduct standards, or alter attendance requirements expected of all\nemployees.\ne. Step Five - Notification\nThe supervisor and/or human resources manager evaluating the request for an accommodation\nshall provide the employee with written notification of the determination within 15 calendar days\nof receiving the completed request (including the requested documentation). If the determination\nincludes an accommodation, the notice will also include the expected implementation date. If the\nsupervisor or the human resources manager needs additional time to assess a request or to\nprovide an accommodation, they shall provide the employee with written notification of the status\nof the request and the proposed date of determination.\n4. Funding\nIf the accommodation is appropriate and reasonable, then the Department bears the initial\nresponsibility for funding the accommodation. If the cost is beyond the Department's means, the\ncost should be shared by higher levels in the Department's/office's reporting line. For information\non additional funding resources for disability-related accommodations, contact the Diversity &\nAccess Office at (650) 725-0326.\n5. Resolving Disagreements\nIn the event an employee disagrees with the determination and/or proposed accommodation,\nthey may contact the ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer at the Diversity & Access Office,\nKingscote Gardens, 419 Lagunita Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, telephone 723-0755, FAX 723-\n179",

Background and Purpose\na. Health Risks\nIt is widely recognized that the misuse and abuse of controlled substances, illegal drugs\n(collectively called controlled substances1 and alcohol are major contributors to serious health\nproblems and social and civic concerns. The health risks associated with the use of illicit drugs\nand the abuse of controlled substances and alcohol include various physical and mental\nconsequences including addiction, severe disability and death. Information concerning the known\neffects of alcohol and specific drugs is available from the Office of Substance Use Programs,\nEducation & Resources (http://super.stanford.edu/) at (650) 723-3429.\nb. Federal Legislation\nIn response to these concerns, the U.S. Congress passed the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988,\nthe Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989 and the Omnibus\nTransportation Employee Testing Act of 1991.In accordance with these Acts, Stanford University\nhas enacted the following policy applicable to all employees and students.\n1Controlled substances are those defined in 21 U.S.C.812 and include, but are not limited to,\nsuch substances as marijuana, heroin, cocaine and amphetamines.\n2. Policy\nIt is the policy of Stanford University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The\nunlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession and/or use of controlled substances\nor the unlawful possession, use or distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Stanford campus, in\nthe workplace or as part of any of the University's activities. (For clarification of what activities\nrelated to controlled substances and alcohol are unlawful, see the Appendix at the end of this\nGuide Memo.) The workplace and campus include all Stanford premises where the activities of\nthe University are conducted. Moreover, employees are prohibited from being under the\ninfluence of controlled substances or alcohol while at work. Violation of this policy may result in\ndisciplinary sanctions up to and including termination of employment or expulsion. Violations may\nalso be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.\na. Employees\nAs a condition of employment, all Stanford employees are expected to report to work in a\ncondition that enables them to perform their job duties, with or without reasonable\naccommodation, in a safe manner that does not jeopardize their own safety or the safety of\nothers.\nEmployees are prohibited from being under the influence of controlled substances or alcohol\nwhile at work. \"Under the influence\" is a condition where an employee's sensory, cognitive, motor\nfunctions or job related capabilities are affected, impaired or diminished and may be exhibited\nthrough various behaviors including slurred speech, difficulty walking, red eyes, erratic or\nthreatening behavior, the odor of alcohol, etc. (Note: Lawfully prescribed prescription drugs used\nin accordance with their instructions are not subject to this policy.)\nEmployees who unlawfully manufacture, distribute, dispense, possess or use controlled\nsubstances or unlawfully use, possess, or distribute alcohol in the workplace, on the campus, or\nas part of any University activity will be subject to discipline up to and including termination of\nemployment. Employees required to obtain Commercial Drivers Licenses to drive vehicles\nheavier than 26,000 pounds, vehicles placarded for the transportation of hazardous materials,\nand/or vehicles designed to carry 16 or more persons are subject to a protocol of testing for the\nuse of drugs and alcohol in accordance with DOT guidelines. Employees at SLAC National\nAccelerator Laboratory must comply with SLAC's Fitness for Duty policy.\nb. Students\nStudents are bound by this policy and the Stanford Student Alcohol and Other Drugs Policy\n(http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/student-alcohol-and-other-drugs-policy).\nc. Others on Campus\nIndividuals who are not Stanford employees, but who perform work at Stanford for its benefit\n(e.g., independent contractors, temporary employees provided by agencies, visitors engaged in\njoint projects at Stanford or volunteers) are required to comply with this policy. Such individuals\nwho violate this policy may be barred from further work for and at Stanford.\nd. Rehabilitation\nSuccessful completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program (including participation in\naftercare) may be considered evidence of eligibility for continued or future employment or for\nreinstatement of student status.\ne. Reporting of Convictions\nAn employee who is convicted (including a plea of nolo contendere) of a criminal drug statute\nviolation occurring in the workplace or on Stanford property must, notify Stanford University of\nthe conviction within five days after the conviction. Notification must be in writing to the local\nhuman resources office, the Associate Vice President of Employee & Labor Relations (for staff)\nor the Dean (for faculty).\n3. Guide to Supervisors\nResponsibility for effective implementation and enforcement of the Stanford Alcohol and Other\nDrugs Policy begins with supervisors. Supervisors must be alert to indications or evidence of the\nuse or presence of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace.\na. Communication\nSupervisors must make sure that employees are aware of Stanford's Controlled Substances and\nAlcohol Policy and understand that violation of this policy is a serious matter and cause for\ndisciplinary action including possible termination.\nb. Consultation with Human Resources\nIf and when an employee is suspected of violating this policy, the supervisor should consult with\nthe local human resources office to plan and carry out an appropriate investigation and resolution\nof the situation.\nc. Impaired Performance on the Job: Under the Influence of Controlled\nSubstances or Alcohol in the Workplace\nPerformance problems on the job can have many causes. In discussions with an employee\nconcerning any performance problem, the supervisor should offer to help the employee\ndetermine the source of the problems and offer guidance on appropriate assistance, counseling\nor other resources.\nWhen job performance has become impaired, the supervisor should take normal corrective\naction, beginning with discussion with the employee. When the behavior of an employee on the\njob raises safety concerns for the employee and/or others in the workplace, the supervisor must\ntake immediate action and prohibit the employee from continuing on the job until it is determined\nthat they are fit to return to work and perform safely. Specific actions to be taken depend on the\nfacts of the particular situation. Supervisors should consult with their local human resources\noffice and document any cases of suspected employee impairment while at work.\nIn a situation when the employee acknowledges to the supervisor that poor performance or\nunacceptable conduct results from a substance or alcohol abuse problem, the supervisor should\nurge the employee to seek help from a qualified substance abuse treatment resource. If the\nemployee requests a leave of absence for a rehabilitation program, the supervisor should take\nnormal steps to review the leave request. After a review of the situation, any misconduct,\nperformance issues or policy violations which occur before, or coincident with, a voluntary\nadmission of impairment may form the basis of disciplinary consequences up to and including\ntermination.\nd.

(The term \"regular employee\" is defined\nin Guide Memo 2.2.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-\nemployment-policies/definitions): Definitions.) For policies that apply to employees covered by a\ncollective bargaining agreement, refer to the agreements at Labor Relations & Collective\nBargaining (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/workplace-essentials/policies/labor-relations-\ncollective-bargaining) on the Cardinal at Work website.  \nNotes:\nFaculty may consult the Faculty Handbook (http://facultyhandbook.stanford.edu/), chapter\n3.\nSee information on each disability plan for specific details about plan eligibility.\n1. Overview\nEligible University employees can participate in a variety of family and medical leaves and\ndisability benefit plans. Policies are described in this document. Before the employee goes out\non leave, they should consult with their local Human Resources office. Important information\nregarding the scope and use of the disability benefit plans is included in the relevant plan\nbrochures available on the Cardinal at Work website.\na. Specific Process for filing a disability claim:\n1. The employee reports the absence (or planned absence) to their immediate supervisor.\n2. The employee calls Stanford's disability administrator to initiate a claim. The disability\nadministrator will inform the employee if there are any forms or certification documents to\nsubmit.\n3. If the employee does not call the disability administrator, it is the department's responsibility\nto notify the disability administrator.\n4. Continue steps per the general process for all disabilities in section 1.b.\nb. General Process:\n(1) Timeliness\nEmployees must give a 30-day advance notice of a family or medical leave. Notice should be\ngiven to the immediate supervisor, the local Human Resources office and the disability\nadministrator. In unforeseeable situations (e.g., hospitalized), employees are expected to notify\nthe above parties as soon as possible.  For work-related leaves, refer to section 45, Workers'\nCompensation.\n(2) Workers' Compensation\nWhen the employee's disability is, or may be, work-related, the department should report the\ncircumstances to the Risk Management Office within 24 hours of the employee's injury. See\nsection 5, Workers' Compensation. SLAC employees should refer to SLAC Human Resources\n(https://policies.slac.stanford.edu/categories/human-resources)for the relevant reporting\nrequirements.\n(3) The local Human Resources office\nThe local Human Resources office works with the employee, their supervisor and the disability\nadministrator to ensure that information is communicated in a timely manner.\n(4) Disability and Leaves Services (DLS)\nDLS within University Human Resources is responsible for updating employee records in the\nHuman Resources Management System (HRMS) during a disability leave. DLS manages the\nemployee’s timecard and ensures that combined pay from the disability administrator and\nStanford does not exceed 100% of the employee base pay.\n(5) Supervisor's Ongoing Communication\nThe supervisor (or local Human Resources office on the supervisor's behalf) should routinely\ncheck the determination made on the employee's claim for short-term (VDI/SDI) disability benefit\nor Workers' Compensation benefit payments. The supervisor should arrange with the employee\nto be kept informed about the estimated return to work date for an employee who is absent for an\nextended period. If the employee is unable to advise the supervisor personally about their\ninability to return to work, the supervisor should make other arrangements to be kept advised of\nthe status of the employee's return to work.\n(6) Medical Certification\nThe employee must contact the disability administrator to initiate a leave request and open a\ndisability or Paid Family Leave (PFL) claim, who will then work with the employee to obtain the\nnecessary certification from a health care provider. The employee must provide certification\nwithin 15 days to the disability administrator. Certification is also required to request a leave\nextension.\n(7) Length of Leave\nMaximum Duration - Except as otherwise required by law, the maximum duration that a\nregular employee is eligible to be on an approved medical leave of absence due to a non-\nwork-related injury or illness is no more than 12 consecutive months, inclusive of any\nperiods of full- or part-time leave, Family Medical leave, pregnancy disability leave, or leave\nfor personal reasons. If, through the interactive process, it is determined that an employee\nis unable to return to work at the end of an approved medical leave with or without\nreasonable accommodations, the employee will be terminated. 12 months of leave is not\nguaranteed. The maximum duration of leave will be determined based on the particular\ncircumstances of the situation, including the operational needs of the department, the\nnumber of times extensions of leave have been previously granted, and any disability\naccommodation leave that may have been granted.\nExceptions - If a proposed leave will result in a total period of absence exceeding 12\nmonths, prior approval is required from the local Human Resources office and in\nconcurrence with the Vice President for Human Resources (or their designee). Requests\nfor exceptions must be submitted in writing to the local Human Resources office. Such\nexceptions are likely to be approved only in limited circumstances.\n2. Family and Medical Leaves\na. Introduction\nFamily Medical Leave is leave authorized by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)\nand/or the California Family Rights Act (CFRA). Certain leaves for members of the armed forces\nand their families are outlined in Guide Memo 2.1.18\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/military-\nleave). In most cases, FMLA and CFRA run concurrently with each other and with Short-Term\nDisability Leave, including leave due to work-related illness or injury, and with Paid Family Leave\n(PFL). Eligible employees are assured up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during a rolling 12-month\nperiod that begins on the verified FMLA/CFRA start date. \"Assured\" means the department\ncannot refuse the leave when any one of the following situations is appropriately verified:\nThe birth of a child or the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster\ncare. Under CFRA, if both parents are employed by Stanford, each parent is eligible for up\nto 12 weeks of baby bonding leave. Limitations: Leave for birth or placement of a child for\nadoption or foster care should generally be taken in blocks of time (two weeks minimum)\nand must be concluded within the first 12 months after the birth or placement. A request for\nbaby bonding leave in less than two weeks' duration may be granted on any two occasions.\nA serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform their job.\nUnder FMLA, the serious health condition of a spouse, same-sex domestic partner, parent,\nor child that requires the employee's absence from work to care for the ill family member.\nUnder CFRA, the serious health condition of a child, parent, parent-in-law (parent of a\nspouse or domestic partner), grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, domestic partner, or\ndesignated person that requires the employee’s absence from work to care for the ill family\nmember. “Designated person” means any individual related by blood or whose association\nwith the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.

The “designated person” may\nbe identified by the employee at the time leave is requested. An employee is limited to one\n“designated person” per 12-month period.\nDefinition of \"Serious Health Condition\"\nSerious health condition (as defined by the Dept. of Labor) means an illness, injury, impairment,\nor physical or mental condition that involves either:\nInpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical-care\nfacility, including any period of incapacity (i.e., inability to work, attend school, or perform\nother regular daily activities) or subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient\ncare; or\nContinuing treatment by a health care provider, which includes:\n1. A period of incapacity lasting more than three consecutive, full calendar days, and\nany subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition that\nalso includes:\na. treatment two or more times by or under the supervision of a health care\nprovider (i.e., in-person visits, the first within seven days and both within 30\ndays of the first day of incapacity); or\nb. one treatment by a health care provider (i.e., an in-person visit within seven\ndays of the first day of incapacity) with a continuing regimen of treatment (e.g.,\nprescription medication, physical therapy); or\n2. Any period of incapacity related to pregnancy or for prenatal care. A visit to the health\ncare provider is not necessary for each absence; or\n3. Any period of incapacity or treatment for a chronic serious health condition that\ncontinues over an extended period, requires periodic visits (at least twice a year) to a\nhealth care provider, and may involve occasional episodes of incapacity. A visit to a\nhealth care provider is not necessary for each absence; or\n4. A period of incapacity that is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which\ntreatment may not be effective. Only supervision by a health care provider is required,\nrather than active treatment; or\n5. Any absences to receive multiple treatments for restorative surgery or for a condition\nthat would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three days if not treated.\nb. Eligibility\nEmployees working in the U.S. are eligible if employed by Stanford at least one year and have\nworked at least 1,250 hours (paid time off, paid leave and unpaid leave not included) during the\n12 months before the start of the requested leave.\nc. Notification\nEmployees are expected to provide 30 days advance notice to their manager when the need for\nleave is foreseeable (i.e., anticipated date of birth, adoption, or planned medical treatment).\nWhen advance notice is not possible, employees should give as much advance notice as\nfeasible. If advance notice was not provided when the employee had sufficient prior knowledge\nof the need for leave, the department may deny leave until 30 days have elapsed. Such denial\nshould be made only when operationally necessary, and always in consultation with the local\nHuman Resources office. Employees are required to give a minimum of two days' notice if the\nreturn to work will be later or earlier than the expected return date.\nd. Medical Certification\nThe employee must call the disability administrator to request FMLA/CFRA leave. The disability\nadministrator will work with the employee to obtain certification from a health care provider that\nthe employee, their child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or\ndomestic partner has a serious health condition, the condition's expected duration, and the need\nfor the employee to attend to the family member. The employee must provide certification within\n15 days to the disability administrator. Certification is also required to request a leave extension.\ne. Intermittent Leave\nUnder some circumstances, employees may take FMLA/CFRA leave intermittently (taking leave\nin separate blocks of time for a single qualifying reason) or on a reduced schedule (reducing the\nemployee's usual weekly or daily work schedule). When leave is needed for planned medical\ntreatment, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment to avoid unduly\ndisrupting department operations.\nFor birth and care of a child or \"baby bonding\" under California (CFRA) law, an employee may\nuse intermittent leave in segments of two weeks. A request for baby bonding leave of less than\ntwo weeks duration may be granted on any two occasions.\n3. Pregnancy and Disability Leave\nCalifornia law currently provides eligible employees up to four months off for pregnancy disability\nleave (PDL). The first three months of PDL run concurrently with the employee's federal FMLA\nentitlement. Following PDL, the employee may be eligible to use up to 12 weeks of California\nFamily Rights Act (CFRA) leave. Verified pregnancy disability leave does not count against an\nemployee's California Family Rights Act (CFRA) leave entitlement unless the employee has\nexhausted the maximum pregnancy disability leave permitted by law.\n4. Paid Organ Donor Leave\na. Introduction\nUnder California law, eligible employees are entitled to a paid leave of absence of up to 30 days\nfor the purpose of organ donation and up to five days for bone marrow donation. For organ\ndonation, eligible employees are entitled to an additional unpaid leave of absence of up to 30\ndays.\nThe leave may be taken in increments during any one-year period. The one-year period starts on\nthe first day of leave. Use of accrued time for a portion of the leave will be required (see section\n4.d). Periods of authorized Paid Organ Donor leave do not run concurrently with either FMLA or\nCFRA leave and are not counted against an employee's annual FMLA/CFRA entitlement.\nb. Eligibility\nThe employee must complete at least 90 days of service with the University before requesting\nPaid Organ Donor leave.\nc. Medical Certification\nThe employee must call the disability administrator to request a Paid Organ Donor leave and\nprovide written medical verification that the employee is an organ or bone marrow donor and the\nmedical necessity for the donation. The disability administrator must receive the certification\nwithin 15 days of the Paid Organ Donor leave request.\nd. Pay During Leave\nDuring the period of Paid Organ Donor leave, employees will be required to use five days of\naccrued time for bone marrow donation and 10 days for organ donation. Once the amount of\nrequired accrued time is used, the employee will be on a paid leave of absence for up to 30 days\nfor organ donation and five days for bone marrow donation.\n5. Workers' Compensation\na. Introduction\nThe purpose of this coverage is to provide partial income continuation during absences resulting\nfrom work-related injuries, illnesses, or exposures and payment of certified medical benefits for\nsuch injuries and illnesses. The university pays the full cost of Workers' Compensation coverage.\nWorkers' Compensation payments are a non-taxable benefit paid directly to the employee by a\nthird-party administrator.\nb. Eligibility\nAll employees of the university, including student employees, staff, and faculty, are covered by\nWorkers' Compensation. Work-related disability provisions are applicable to contingent\nemployees (e.g., temporary and casual employees), and student employees, as defined in Guide\nMemo 2.2.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/definitions): Definitions.\nc. Reporting Work-related Incidents and Associated Absences From Work\nDepartments have additional requirements for reporting all work-related injuries and illnesses.\nSee Guide Memo 7.6.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/health-and-safety/accident-\nand-incident-reporting/employee-work-related-incident-reporting): Employee Work-Related\nIncident Reporting.\nSee also, the Stanford",

Payments\nThe Workers' Compensation administrator normally pays benefits from the fourth day of the\ndisability period or the first day of hospitalization, whichever occurs first. If the employee is out of\nwork for more than 14 days (need not be consecutive) with a doctor's authorization, the three-\nday waiting period is waived, and retroactive payments will be made so that payments start with\nthe first day of disability. For Workers' Compensation, Stanford charges up to the initial five full\nwork days of absence (days need not be consecutive) of an accepted claim to work-related\ndisability paid leave. The university will augment the Workers' Compensation benefit with salary\nduring this period. An employee's sick time or vacation is not charged for these days of absence.\nBy state law, an employee may not receive both Workers' Compensation benefits and full pay.\nTherefore, employees are required to reimburse the university for any Workers' Compensation\nbenefits paid for the first five days including any associated holidays, because the university has\nalready paid the employee for the time. For part-time employees, the full day is prorated based\non the employee's normal work schedule.\ne. Delayed Claims\nIf acceptance of a claim is delayed, the initial five full days of absence (need not be consecutive)\nare charged to accumulated sick time and the leave is handled as a short-term non-work-related\ndisability. If accumulated sick time is exhausted, the time is charged to accrued PTO, floating\nholiday, and vacation, in that order. If the employee does not have enough accrued time, the\nremaining hours are unpaid. If the claim is then accepted under Workers' Compensation, any\nsick, PTO, floating holiday, and /or vacation time taken during the first five days will be restored.\nf. Supplementing Workers' Compensation Payments\nEmployees may receive both paid leave and disability plan benefits concurrently, not to exceed\nthe employee's base pay. After the initial five work days of disability, accumulated sick, PTO,\nfloating holiday, and vacation time will be used, in that order, to supplement Workers'\nCompensation benefits. Thus, the employee continues to receive income equivalent to full pay.\ng. Role of Disability and Leaves Services (DLS)\nDLS within University Human Resources is responsible for updating employee records in the\nHuman Resources Management System (HRMS) during a disability leave. DLS manages the\nemployee’s timecard and ensures that combined pay from the disability administrator and\nStanford does not exceed 100% of the employee base pay.\nh. More Information\nDetails regarding claims procedures, incident reports, and related matters may be obtained from\nthe Office of Risk Management and Insurance (https://orm.stanford.edu/insurance/workers-\ncompensation), (650) 723-7400. Also, Guide Memo 7.6.1\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/health-and-safety/accident-and-incident-\nreporting/employee-work-related-incident-reporting): Employee Work-Related Incident Reporting,\nhas additional information about Workers' Compensation. SLAC employees should refer to SLAC\nHuman Resources (https://policies.slac.stanford.edu/categories/human-resources). \n6. Income during Family and Medical Leaves\na. Use of Accrued Time\nAccrued time consists of sick time, PTO for the calendar year, floating holiday for the calendar\nyear and vacation, to be used in that order. During medical leaves (including Workers'\nCompensation, FMLA, CFRA, and PDL), the university will use an employee's accrued time to\nmaintain the employee's base pay. For Paid Family Leaves (PFL), please see section 6.d. When\nthe employee is also receiving disability benefits, DLS ensures that combined income from both\nthe disability vendor and the University does not exceed pre-disability pay. Accrued time is used\nuntil the employee goes off disability, including Worker's Compensation, or until all balances are\nexhausted. The use of some forms of accrued time is at the employee's option during certain\nFMLA/CFRA leaves. If an employee chooses not to use accrued time during a medical leave, the\nemployee must notify DLS by email within 24-48 hours of their claim being approved. An\nemployee's request to opt out of the payment practice can only be for future pay cycles and not\nretroactively. Disability and Leave Services (DLS) administers the employee's records in the\nHuman Resources Management System (HRMS). Procedures at SLAC will differ.\nThus, if the employee has accrued time and is also receiving disability benefits, the employee will\nreceive disability checks from the disability administrator and/or the Worker's Compensation\nadministrator and reduced paychecks from the university until their accrued time has been\nexhausted. Once the accrued time is exhausted, the employee will only receive disability checks\nfrom the disability vendor for the duration of the approved leave.\nb. Overpayment\nIf an employee has been overpaid, the employee must reimburse the university for the\noverpayment either by direct payment or through payroll deduction. Failure to repay an\noverpayment could result in disciplinary action.\nc. Voluntary Disability Insurance (VDI)/Short-Term Disability (STD)\n(1) Introduction\nThe university's VDI plan is state-approved to take the place of SDI by providing benefits that are\nbetter than those of the state's plan. The VDI plan provides partial income continuation for\nperiods of disability of up to 52 weeks or a maximum dollar amount. This plan is described in the\nStatement of Coverage available on the Cardinal at Work website\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/time-away/leaves-of-absence/disability-\nbenefits). For information on SDI, go to the State of California Employment Development\nDepartment's website (http://www.edd.ca.gov/).\n(2) Eligibility\nFaculty and staff based in California are covered for short-term disabilities by either the\nuniversity's Voluntary Disability Insurance plan (VDI) or State Disability Insurance (SDI) if the\nemployee opted out of VDI. Non-California employees are covered under a separate 26-week\nshort-term disability plan (STD).\n(3) Benefit Waiting Period\nRefer to the Voluntary Disability Insurance Statement of Coverage on the Cardinal at Work\nwebsite (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/time-leaves/leaves-\nabsence/disability-leave/voluntary-disability-insurance-vdi).\n(4) Taxability\nShort-term disability (VDI/SDI) payments are non-taxable benefits. These non-taxable benefits\nare paid directly to the employee by the disability administrator.\nd. Paid Family Leave (PFL)\n(1) Introduction\nThis California state program provides partial income replacement during absences from work to\ncare for seriously ill family members (parent, child, spouse, registered domestic partner,\ngrandparent, grandchild, sibling, or parent-in-law) or to bond with a new child. It is not a separate\ntype of leave.\n(2) Eligibility\nFaculty and staff based in California contribute to a Paid Family Leave (PFL) insurance benefit\naccording to state law as part of the VDI deduction.\n(3) Supplementing PFL Payments\nDuring PFL, eligible employees will receive a portion of their base pay, up to a weekly maximum,\nfrom the disability administrator or state disability program, for up to eight weeks in a rolling 12-\nmonth period. The university will supplement the approved state paid family leave benefit to\nmaintain the eligible employee’s base pay for the first six weeks that the employee is receiving\nPFL benefits. For the additional two weeks that the employee is eligible for PFL benefits, they\nmay elect to use sick, vacation, floating holiday or PTO time, combined with the approved state\nleav",

For the additional two weeks that the employee is eligible for PFL benefits, they\nmay elect to use sick, vacation, floating holiday or PTO time, combined with the approved state\nleave, to maintain their base pay. Together, the state PFL and the university’s supplement will not\nexceed 100% of an employee’s base pay as of their last day worked before starting their leave. \nDisability and Leave Services (DLS) within University Human Resources administers the\nemployee's records in the Human Resources Management System (HRMS). DLS ensures that\ncombined income from both the disability vendor and the university does not exceed pre-\ndisability pay.

Failure to repay an\noverpayment could result in disciplinary action.\n(5) Taxability\nPFL is a non-taxable benefit for state and FICA but is a taxable benefit for Federal tax purposes.\n(6) More Information\nThe benefit is described on the Cardinal at Work website\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/time-away/leaves-of-absence/family-care-\nleave). Forms are available on this website in the Resource Library.\ne. Long-Term Disability (LTD)\n(1) Introduction\nThis plan provides partial income continuation during longer periods of disability. LTD benefits\ncould start after a disability period of 180 consecutive days. After a disability period of 15 months,\nthe plan's benefits are more restricted because a more stringent definition of \"disability\" is used.\n(2) Eligibility\nEmployees whose approved disability continues past 180 consecutive days may be eligible for\nLong-Term Disability. The disability vendor provides the employee with the appropriate\ninformation when the employee's disability period approaches 180 days.\nEligible employees based outside of California in a state that offers paid family leave must apply\nfor paid family benefits through their state.\nEligible employees based outside of California in a state that does not offer paid family leave\nbenefits can file a paid family claim through Stanford's disability vendor.\n(3) Taxability\nLong-term disability benefits are taxable for federal and state, non-taxable for FICA.\n(4) More Information\nThe Summary Plan Description for the Long-Term Disability Plan provides information about\ncoverage, definition of disability, and benefits. It is available on the Cardinal at Work website\n(https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/time-leaves/leaves-absence/disability-\nleave/long-term-disability-insurance-ltd).\n7. Benefits During Disability Periods\na. Health and Life Benefits\n(1) Paid Leave\nEmployees on paid FMLA/CFRA, PFL, VDI or Workers' Compensation will have their applicable\nbenefit contributions deducted from their reduced paychecks. See (3) for LTD.\n(2) Unpaid Leave\nEmployees on unpaid PFL, VDI, Workers' Compensation, and all LTD participants (paid or\nunpaid) will have the same university benefit contributions as when actively employed. The\nemployee will be billed for the employee portion of the costs on an after-tax basis.\n(3) LTD and Part-Time Work\nIf an employee continues to receive LTD benefits, but is able to work part-time, there will be no\nchange in benefit contributions. Employees will have applicable benefit contributions deducted\nfrom their reduced paychecks.\nb. Retirement Savings Plan (SCRP)\n(1) Paid Leave\nWhen an employee continues to receive pay from the university, retirement savings plan benefit\naccruals and/or contributions continue, subject to plan provisions.\n(2) LTD Plus Paid Leave\nEmployees who supplement LTD benefits with accrued time (e.g., sick, vacation, PTO, floating\nholiday) will have that paid time counted as earnings for university retirement savings plans,\nsubject to plan provisions.\nc. Retiree Medical Eligibility\nDuring the first 180 days on Short-Term Disability or Workers' Compensation, time is counted\ntoward official retiree medical eligibility. After 180 days on disability, the time does not count\ntoward official retiree medical eligibility.\nd. Benefits in Cases of Termination\n(1) Medical and Dental Coverage\nA regular employee whose university employment is terminated while the employee is receiving\nbenefit payments from a Short-Term Disability plan or Workers' Compensation plan may continue\nmedical and dental coverages at their own expense through COBRA for 18 months, or until LTD\nis approved. \n(2) Life Insurance\nLife insurance portability or conversion to an individual plan is available. The employee should\ncontact Stanford Benefits at the time of termination for the appropriate forms.\n8. For More Information\nEmployees can consult with the local Human Resources Office or review the Cardinal at Work\nwebsite (https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/time-away/leaves-of-absence).\nGeneral questions about State Disability Insurance (SDI) and Workers' Compensation should be\nreferred to the appropriate government office.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/employment-benefit-\nprograms/disability-and-family-leaves",

What to do in the Event of an Accident\n(1) Emergency Action\nTake whatever steps are immediately necessary to render emergency medical care, salvage\nproperty, or reduce the further extent of the loss. If anyone is injured, see Guide Memo 7.2.1\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/health-and-safety/emergency-and-accident-\nprocedures/emergencyaccident-procedures): Emergency/Accident Procedures, for emergency\nprocedures, and Guide Memo 7.6.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/health-and-\nsafety/accident-and-incident-reporting/employee-work-related-incident-reporting): Accident and\nIncident Reporting, for reporting requirements. Report injuries promptly to comply with state law.\n(2) Evidence for Insurance Claim\nIf possible, do not disturb the evidence or hazard which caused the claim until the area can be\ninspected, pictures taken, and conditions recorded. Obtain the names and addresses of parties\ninvolved, witnesses, etc. Under no circumstances should one admit liability; to do so could\njeopardize the insurance coverage. As soon as possible record the details of the accident. The\nreport should include: the date, time, place, who or what was involved, how it happened, names,\naddresses, and estimated ages of persons involved; description of injury, loss, or damage; and\naction that was or will be taken to prevent a recurrence. All claims must be reported immediately\nto Risk Management.\n2. Property Insurance\na.

Please see the Risk Management and Insurance website\n(https://orm.stanford.edu/) for a current list of excluded countries.\n(3) Deductible\nThe first $1,500,000 of each claim is self-insured by the university. The department that suffered\nthe loss or damage of property pays for the first $10,000 of each claim. \n(4) Claim Processing\nRisk Management processes all claims for the replacement value or repair of University property\nthat has been stolen, destroyed, or damaged. Depending upon the type, size, and location of the\nloss, Procurement or Land, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE) will be directly involved in the\nrepairs or reconstruction. The preparation of specifications and a bidding process may be\nnecessary. Risk Management must receive copies of all contracts, work orders, and purchase\nrequisitions.\nIn the event a claim exceeds $10,000, insurance or self-insurance may pay for repair or\nreplacement value (whichever is less). \"Replacement value\" means the cost to repair or replace\n(not book value). Loss settlements are based on the cost to repair or replace with like kind and\nquality. Any upgrading will be at the cost of the department that suffers the loss.

Budgeting Total Property Insurance Expense\n1. Total Property Insurance Expense includes General Property Insurance and Boilers,\nPressure Vessels, and Heavy Machinery Insurance. Following the end of each fiscal year,\nthe Risk Management department will secure an actuarial study of claims under the\nProperty Insurance Program.

Self-insurance reserve required to fund claims (and related expenses) that have\noccurred prior to the end of the recently completed fiscal year but have not yet been\nsettled/completed. (This can be an accumulation of several years of claims estimates,\nnet of settlements). This actuarial required reserve may be higher or lower than the\nactual reserve balance at Fiscal Year End.\nb. Actuarial projected self-insurance funding levels, or cost of claims and expenses that\nwill be incurred in the next fiscal year. This will be the amount added to the reserve\nbalance each year to cover claims incurred in that year.\n2. During the budget planning cycle (and no later than February 1), Risk Management will\nprovide the Budget Office with the Aggregate Annual Premium to be charged internally for\nProperty Insurance during the next fiscal year. At the same time, Risk Management will\nalso provide the income-producing operations, formula schools, and auxiliaries with their\nrespective property premium allocation to be charged during the next fiscal year. The\nAggregate Premium will be composed of the following four elements:\na.

While at any time during thefiscal year a fund may go into deficit, by the end of the fiscal year, any fund with a deficit equal to or inexcess of $1,000 in cash must be made whole by some other appropriate funding source. Exceptionsto this policy must be approved by the University Budget Office and the Office of the University’s ChiefFinancial Officer.\n2. Basis of Accounting\na. Fund Accounting\nThe University maintains its accounts in accordance with the principles of fund accounting. Becausethe University receives funding from a variety of sources, with different types of terms and restrictions,each source must be tracked as a separate accounting entity in a unique fund.\nb. Restrictions on Use of Funds\nFund restrictions are classified differently for internal and external reporting purposes.  While some ofthe terms overlap, they have different meanings depending on the reporting context.  For externalreporting purposes, the definitions are based on generally accepted accounting principles.  For internalreporting purposes, the definitions are based on the use of the funds.\n(1) Internal Reporting Definitions\nRestricted: When a donor makes a gift to the University, the donor may provide terms for the useof that gift.  If the terms specify a particular purpose, the funds are restricted to that purpose. Income and appreciation produced by restricted endowments is also restricted as per the termsof the endowment.  Funding provided by sponsored agencies or corporations for specific grant orcontract work is also considered restricted.Unrestricted: Funds without donor terms or with terms that allow the funds to be used anywhereat the University.  If donor terms allow a gift to be used broadly within a school or unit, it isdeemed Unrestricted at the unit level, but Restricted by central University administration.Designated: These are unrestricted funds that have been designated for a specific purpose bythe Board of Trustees or senior management.  Internal units in the University can designateunrestricted resources to any number of specific purposes, but from a broader analyticalperspective those funds are unrestricted for purposes of internal reporting.\n(2) External Reporting Definitions\nPermanently Restricted: The University classifies as Permanently Restricted (a) the originalvalue of gifts donated to the Endowment and (b) accumulations to the Endowment made inaccordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument.Temporarily Restricted: Temporarily Restricted assets include gifts and pledges that are subjectto donor-imposed restrictions that expire with the passage of time, payment of pledges, orspecific actions to be undertaken by the University or the Hospitals; these assets are thenreleased and reclassified as Unrestricted.  In addition, appreciation and income on certain donor-restricted endowments funds are classified as Temporarily Restricted until authorized forspending.  Donor-restricted resources intended for capital projects are initially recorded asTemporarily Restricted and released from their temporary restrictions and reclassified asUnrestricted when the asset is placed in service.  Also included in this category is the University’snet equity in split interest agreements, expendable at maturity.Unrestricted: Funds that are not Permanently Restricted or Temporarily Restricted are treated asUnrestricted for external reporting purposes.  This includes expendable gifts that have donorrestrictions, so long as the University is free to spend the gift.  Funds Functioning as Endowment,or FFE, are University resources designated by the Board or internal University units to be heldas endowment.  FFE is usually considered Unrestricted per accounting rules, as are most otherexpendable resources in the University.\nc. Chart of Accounts\nStanford’s accounting system uses an alphanumeric code, or chart of accounts. The fund number, alsoreferred to as the award number, is included in the chart of accounts.  The University accountingsystem also records attributes assigned to each fund that further define the fund purpose andrestrictions.  For a detailed explanation of its structure, please see Stanford's Gateway to FinancialActivities (http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/acctstructure/index.html). \nThe Controller's Office, a unit in Financial Management Services (FMS), and the departments andindividuals authorized to spend funds in an account share responsibility for using the chart of accountsappropriately. The Controller's Office is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the chart of accountsand for assigning fund and other account numbers. Schools and departments are responsible forcommunicating any restrictions on use of funds so that Controller's Office staff can set up the accountcorrectly. Find information on the various kinds of expenditure accounts in Guide Memo 3.1.3(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-management/expenditure-accounts-ptas): Expenditure Accounts (PTAs).\n3. Fund Groups\nThe University combines funds with similar characteristics into fund groups for budgeting, planning,and reporting purposes.\na. Expendable Resources\nExpendable resources are available for the current operation of the University; balances can beaccumulated for future expenditure. Sources of funds include, but are not limited to, the following:\n(1) Contracts and Grants\nFunds provided by sponsors to reimburse the direct costs of contracts and grants are restricted perinternal reporting definitions. The terms of the award and applicable regulations determine how themoney may be spent. To apply for a contract or grant the principal investigator for the project submits aproposal through the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) or its delegate to the sponsor. OSRnegotiates the award with the sponsor. For more information, see the OSR website(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/topics/award-acceptance#Federal_Research_Terms_and_Conditions).\n(2) Tuition and Fees\nThe Board of Trustees sets tuition and fee rates. The Student Financial Services Office collects tuitionand fee payments from registered students each quarter. Income from tuition and fees is unrestrictedper internal reporting definitions.\n(3) Gifts\nDonor gifts that are not ultimately directed to the endowment are usually considered expendable;exceptions include cases where the funds are not available for the current operation of the University,such as Pending funds and Donor Advised Funds.  Donors typically specify the purpose of gifts, whichwill determine whether the gifts are assigned to expendable, capital, or endowed purposes. The Officeof Development solicits and processes gifts to the University. For more information, see Chapter 4(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/giving-stanford): Giving to Stanford.\n(4) Reimbursement of Facilities and Administrative Costs (Indirect Costs)\nThe Cost and Management Analysis Office calculates  rates that are charged to each contract andgrant to pay for facilities and administrative overhead costs associated with sponsored research. Thesecosts include utilities, building maintenance, and administrative support.  The responsible agency forthe federal government, which for Stanford is the Office of Naval Research (ONR), approves the rates.Indirect cost reimbursements are unrestricted funds per internal reporting definitions.

Information onrate calculations and policy is available on the DoResearch (https://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/proposal-preparation-submission/rates) website. \n(5) Reimbursement of Facilities Costs (Infrastructure and Utilities Charges)\nDesignated Funds and Restricted Funds that do not otherwise pay facilities-related costs (bothSponsored and Non-sponsored) are charged an infrastructure fee to offset operations, maintenance,and utilities costs paid by University unrestricted funds. The fee is a percentage of certain types ofexpenditures, and these reimbursements are unrestricted funds per internal reporting definitions. Moreinformation is available in Guide Memo 3.3.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/infrastructure-charges-and-expendable-funds/infrastructure): Infrastructure Charges.\n(6) Auxiliary Activities\nAuxiliaries are self-contained financial entities (see Guide Memo 3.1.3(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-management/expenditure-accounts-ptas): Expenditure Accounts (PTAs)). Income is used to support operations, includingoverhead, and all income is considered unrestricted per internal reporting definitions.\n(7) Special Program Fees & Other Income\nIncome from outside sources related to programs, patents and royalties, program activities, affiliations,ticket income and the like are collected throughout the institution.  Much of this income is subject to theInfrastructure and Utilities Charge.  All of it is considered unrestricted per internal reporting definitions.\nb. Endowment Funds\nFunds in the Endowment include:\n(1) True Endowment:\nEndowment funds created pursuant to the terms of a donor’s gift.  These funds are generally intendedto last in perpetuity.  Funds established with gifts directed to the endowment are typically used topurchase “pure” shares in the Merged Pool, and in rare circumstances are held in assets specificallydirected by the donor.  True Endowment and payout from True Endowment are considered restrictedper internal reporting definitions if the donor terms specify a particular purpose.\nThe Board of Trustees establishes an annual payout rate for distributions from the University’sendowment funds.  Payout may be made from True Endowment without limitation to income as long as\nthe payout rate is prudently established and the gift terms do not provide otherwise. There is a group offunds referred to as “Pool A” funds that are established by gifts with terms that specify something likethe following: “income but no appreciation” may be paid out of the fund. These types of funds aretypically no longer established by the University. There are also funds that contain what are known as“Pool B Limited” shares. This situation arises where the donor specifies something like the following:only income and appreciation above the original gift value may be paid out. These types of funds arealso typically no longer established by the University. Funds without such terms of limitation arereferred to in the University accounting system as “Unlimited.\"Payout generated by a true endowmentfund that cannot be used for operational purposes can be redirected back to the principal of the fundfor investment if provided for in the donor's gift agreement, or at the request of an internal Universityunit.  When the funds are reinvested pursuant to a provision in the donor’s gift agreement, they add“pure” shares to the Endowment; when they are reinvested at the request of an internal unit they add“quasi” shares to the Endowment. In both cases, reinvestment takes place at year end unless theprovision in the donor's gift agreement specifically provides that all payout be reinvested until the TrueEndowment fund reaches a certain level, in which case reinvestment is made monthly. All suchreinvestment is subject to the same donor terms as the original Endowment gift, and is restricted perinternal reporting definitions if the donor terms specify a particular purpose. Any reinvestment ofunused payout by an internal University unit must be requested by July 31 for the given fiscal year.ForTrue Endowment funds that contain Pool B Limited shares, payout is limited to income andappreciation in any year. Withdrawals in excess of income and appreciation are only permitted if thatfund also contains quasi shares, in which case up to the full value of all quasi shares can be sold tomake the full regular payout for that year (or as much of the full regular payout as possible).  Requestsfor such withdrawals must be made by July 31 for the given fiscal year; refer to the form WithdrawalGuidelines for True Endowment(http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/docs/endowment/withdawal_guidelines_true_endowment.pdf).\n(2) Funds Functioning as Endowment (or Quasi-Endowment Funds):\nFunds Functioning as Endowment (FFE) are expendable resources (both restricted and unrestrictedper internal reporting definitions) that are invested in the Merged Pool (MP) and are considered part ofthe University’s Endowment. These are created at the request of an internal University unit(department, school, etc.). In order to create a new FFE, the unit must invest a minimum of $1 million.The minimum addition of “new” money to an existing FFE is $250,000. The University’s Chief FinancialOfficer and Provost are jointly authorized to make an exception to these minimums. Requests to createFFE must be approved by both the Dean or Chair, and the school’s or unit’s Senior Financial Officer.Requests to approve the creation of FFE involving gift funding must be reviewed by the Office ofPlanned Giving.\nTo optimize investment returns, the University takes a long term perspective of its investments in theMP which requires minimal unplanned cash flow volatility in the portfolio.  Thus, the MP should not beused by individual fundholders to support short term needs.  Accordingly, FFE invested in the MP thesefunds are subject to the following guidelines:\nLock-up Periods:\nAny FFE investment made on or after September 1, 2016, is subject to a 7-year initial “lock-up”period, during which it cannot be redeemed.Any FFE investment made prior to September 1, 2016 is subject to the previous 5-year initial“lock-up” period, during which it cannot be redeemed.\nAnnual Withdrawal Limits:\nOnce the “lock-up” period is met, FFE can be withdrawn under the following conditions:\nFFE invested on or after September 1, 2016 are subject to an annual withdrawal limit, which isthe greater of:$5 million, or10% of an individual fund’s market value. The 10% limit will be calculated as 10% of thefund’s market value which is eligible for withdrawal at the time the request is made, less anyamount that has been redeemed or is pending redemption during the same fiscal year.\nFFE invested prior to September 1, 2016 are governed by the previous FFE policy, and are notsubject to an annual withdrawal limit.\nRequired Approvals:\nWithdrawals are also subject to the following approval authority:\nWithdrawals in keeping with these guidelines may be transferred out of the endowment withthe approval of the school financial officer, the University Chief Financial Officer and the Provost.Smaller amounts may be withdrawn only if the remaining balance is being withdrawn.Withdrawals outside these guidelines are not typically allowed and extraordinary exceptionsrequire an action of the Board of Trustees.\nNotification Periods:\nIn order to provide the Stanford Management Company with sufficient time to divest assets, requestsfor withdrawals must be received by Fund Accounting based on the following minimum notificationrequirements prior to anticipated month of withdrawal:\nUp to $150 million – 90 days$150 million-$250 million – 150 daysGreater than $250 million – 270 days\nPlease refer to the \"Investment and Withdrawal Guidelines",

If a unit chooses not to request the automatic year endreinvestment, they may contact Fund Accounting by July 31 to specify the amount that should bereinvested for the given fiscal year.\n(3) Term Endowments:\nEndowment created at the request of a donor, but intended to be fully spent down on a timelineestablished by the donor. These monies are used to purchase “quasi” shares in the Endowment.Regular withdrawals are made as per the donor terms.\nc. Non-Endowment Funds invested in the Merged Pool\nFunds in this group include, but are not limited to:\n(1) Life Income Gifts:\nA life income gift allows donors to give assets to Stanford while providing themselves or others withincome for a period of time before Stanford is permitted to use the gift; until that period has ended, thegift is not counted as part of the University Endowment. The university, as trustee, manages theinvestment of the assets and pays a specified income to the donor, the donor’s designatedbeneficiaries, or both. Income payments continue for the beneficiaries' lives or, in some cases, for aterm of up to 20 years.\n(2) Donor Advised Funds:\nStanford has Donor Advised Funds. For more information on the size and type of gifts required tocreate a Donor Advised Fund at Stanford, and the amount of the fund that must ultimately be\ndesignated for the use of the University, please refer to the Office of Development’s website(http://giving.stanford.edu/planned-giving/giving-options/donor-advised-funds). In cases where all orpart of a Donor Advised Fund is later used to establish or add to an Endowment fund, it is not countedas part of the Endowment until the funds are explicitly transferred to the endowed fund for use per theterms of the donor’s request.\n(3) Pending Funds:\nThese are gifts where the purpose is pending final designation by the donor and the university. Incases where all or part of a Pending Fund is later used to establish or add to an Endowment fund, it isnot counted as part of the Endowment until the funds are explicitly transferred to the endowed fund foruse per the terms of the donor’s request.\nd. Student Loan Funds\nStudent Loan Funds are not meant to be expensed, but rather are loaned to students as a portion ofthe financial aid package. As these loans are repaid, the principal and accumulated interest becomeavailable for new student loans.\ne. Plant Funds\nPlant Funds are funds that have been received or designated by the Trustees for facilities andretirement of indebtedness. They also include all of the University's investments in long-lived capitalassets and related liabilities.\nf. Agency Funds\nThese are funds held for others, with Stanford acting as the custodian. Funds in this group representliabilities owed by the University.\n4. Intermediate Pool Funds\nIntermediate Pool Mechanics\nThe Intermediate Pool (IP) functions as a unitized pool with shares and share prices, similar to theMerged Pool.  The net return of the portfolio, less the cost to administer the portfolio, is allocated to theindividual participating funds.  Returns are not distributed on a scheduled basis, but are reinvested andaccumulated in the participating funds.\nShareholder Policies\nThe Intermediate Pool is open to the following types of shareholders:\nNew Pending Funds not intended for endowmentNew Donor Advised Funds (DAFs), or portions of DAFs, not intended for Stanford’s endowmentNew additions to the Land Development FundHospital investmentsSchool and Department Funds (SDF) (e.g. The Stanford Business School Trust, StanfordEngineering Venture Fund, DAPER Investment Fund, etc.)Intermediate term reserves from school and unitsA portion of the Expendable Funds Pool (EFP), at the discretion of the University’s ChiefFinancial OfficerDebt recycling pool and unexpended debt proceedsOther centrally managed funds, at the discretion of the University’s Chief Financial Officer\nRequests to invest school and unit reserves in the IP made by a school or academic department mustbe approved by both the Dean or Chair, and the school’s Senior Financial Officer.\nRequests from an auxiliary must be approved by a University Vice Provost or Vice President. \nRequests from an administrative unit must be approved by the Provost.\nMinimum Investment Amounts and Lock-up Periods\nPending Funds invested in the IP require an initial investment amount of at least $500,000.  Exceptionsto this policy must be approved by the Vice President for Development. \nAll other investments in the IP, including both initial investment and additions, must be in increments ofat least $1 million. Exceptions must be approved by the University’s Chief Financial Officer.\nSchool and unit reserves invested in the IP are subject to a four year lock-up period, during which theschool or unit may not withdraw from the fund.\nSMC’s Intermediate Pool Investment Policy Guidelines\nSMC manages the investment policy of the IP with the intention of replicating the debt and equityexposure of a well-balanced global investment portfolio, investing in passive index funds.\n5. Budgeting\nEach year the University prepares a consolidated budget based on estimates of income and expenses.Budgeting enables the University to verify fund availability when processing expenditures.\na. Responsibilities \n1. The Provost is the University's chief academic officer and chief budget officer. The developmentof the University's Consolidated Budget is a principal responsibility of this officer.2. The Vice Provost for Budget and Auxiliaries Management directs and manages, on behalf of theProvost, the process leading to the development of the Consolidated Budget.3. Budget Officers in schools and departments coordinate all budget activities within their respectiveorganizations in collaboration with the University Budget Office in the Provost's Office and theController's Office.4. The University Budget Office in the Provost's Office maintains the budget system, approves thebudget submissions of all schools and departments, and monitors and reports on variances fromthe approved budget.\nb. Annual Budget Process/Cycle\nThe budget process is directed by the University Budget Office.\n(1) Forecasts\nIn the spring, budget officers prepare high-level income and expense forecasts for the following year.The University Budget Office uses these forecasts to prepare the University consolidated budgetforecast that they present, via the Stanford University Budget Plan, to the Board of Trustees forapproval.\n(2) Consolidated Budget\nFollowing the approval of the Stanford University Budget Plan (Consolidated Forecast) by the Board ofTrustees, budget officers record the final, detailed, account-by-account budget for both revenues andexpenses (salary and non-salary) in the budgeting system. As of September 1, it is the officialUniversity Consolidated Budget.\n(3) Variance Reporting\nPeriodically through the year, as determined by University management, budget officers provideanalysis and explanation of the variance between actual income and expense (or projected income\nand expense) and the Consolidated Budget in accordance with the guidelines provided by theUniversity Budget Office. As necessary, analysis and explanation of changes from the previous fiscalyear to the current fiscal year are also provided by the budget units. The University B",

The University Budget Office usesthis information to prepare high-level variance analysis for the Board of Trustees and Universitymanagement.\n6. Fund Transfers\nFund transfers are accounting entries that move all, or a portion of, a fund's balance to another fund.The appropriateness of a fund transfer is dependent on the characteristics of the source anddestination funds, including the type of fund, the restrictions of the fund, whether the source anddestination fund share the same infrastructure and EFP (Expendable Funds Pool) treatment, etc.Generally, fund transfers are allowed when the characteristics of the source and destination fundsconform to one another and the terms of each fund does not preclude such a transfer. These transfersare used to:\nMove money between designated funds or between restricted funds (generally transfers betweena restricted fund and a designated fund are not allowed, nor are transfers to/from a sponsoredproject fund)Transfer money into or between plant fundsAllocate and reallocate general (unrestricted) funds among budget unitsIncrease or decrease restricted funds’ support of an Operating Budget account\nAuthorized central office staff typically performs fund transfers.\nAs transfer of funding creates an initial disconnect between where the funds were collected and wherethey were used (appropriated), strong controls and audit trails of fund transfers are required by theUniversity and is responsible business practice.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-management/university-funds",

    "text": "3.1.3 Expenditure Accounts (PTAs)\nAuthorityApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer.Last UpdatedAugust 11, 2014\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 34.2\nThe University's Oracle Financial system has two core accounting applications: Grants Accounting (GA) andGeneral Ledger (GL). The GA subledger records all detailed expenditure transactions and then summarizes them inthe GL. The GA module has five segments: Project (P), Task (T), Award (A), Expenditure types (E) andOrganization. A Project (P) is an activity or event with a single purpose. A Task (T) is a further breakdown of theproject; every project has at least one task. An Award (A) is a funding source for a particular project or task. Findfurther information on the University's Chart of Accounts at Stanford's Gateway to Financial Activities(http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/acctstructure/index.html).  This Guide Memo describes the variouskinds of expenditure accounts or PTAs (the intersection of Project, Task, and Award) within the University'saccounting system.\n1. Operating Budget PTA\na. Purpose\nOperating Budget PTAs are the primary PTAs for the University's core academic programs and support services.Operating Budget PTAs are used to record accounting transactions for these core activities.\nb. Source of Funds\nAt the beginning of the fiscal year, Operating Budget PTAs receive money only from University unrestricted fundsand from appropriate departmental designated funds, gift funds, and endowment income funds (see Guide Memo3.1.2 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-management/university-funds): University Funds). Changes in funding during the year may be made online by authorized budget officers.\nc. Setting Up\nThe Fund Accounting department of the Controller's Office sets up and maintains PTAs funded from the University'sOperating Budget. To request a new Operating Budget P, T, and/or A, a person who has organizational authoritysubmits the Fund Accounting PTA Request form via email to Fund Accounting in the Controller's Office. The form islocated at Stanford's Gateway to Financial Activities (http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/acctstructure/forms.html). Forstep-by-step instructions, see Quick Steps: Request New PTA(http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/acctstructure/quick_steps/request_newPTA.html). \nd. Fiscal Year End\nAt fiscal year end (August 31), all unused restricted funds that are held in an Operating Budget Award must bereturned to their original source fund. If expenditures have exceeded the Expense Control, other sources of fundingmust be identified to cover the deficit. If there are still budgeted funds available, work with the University's BudgetOffice to determine how to handle these funds.\ne. Closing an Operating Budget PTA\nAt any time, a department may send a memo to Fund Accounting in the Controller's Office requesting that anOperating Budget P, T, and/or A be closed to expense. The P, T, and/or A will be closed as of the first of the monthfollowing the month in which the memo is received, unless otherwise stipulated.\n2. Grant and Contract PTA\na. Purpose\nA grant or contract fund and related expenditure PTA(s) are used to record accounting transactions for a sponsoredproject. The Research Policy Handbook 13.1 (https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-\nhandbook/definitions-and-types-agreements/gift-vs-sponsored-projects-and-distinctions-other-forms-funding), setsout criteria for determining if external support for a project should be handled as a sponsored project. Note thatexternal support that does not meet these criteria is handled as a gift.\nb. Source of Funds\nA grant or contract fund receives money from the agency sponsoring the research, instruction, or other sponsoredactivity at the University. Proposals for grants and contracts are processed through the Office of SponsoredResearch (OSR) or its delegates. Additional information is available at the DoResearch(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/fiscal-responsibilities-principal-investigators/preparation-and-submission-proposal-budgets) website. \nc. Setting Up\nWhen a grant or contract has been awarded, OSR assigns a fund (award) number for the sponsored project, andsets up related Project(s) and Task(s) as requested. OSR handles any subsequent accounting system maintenanceduring the life of the award. OSR also receives awards for student aid directly from a school or from the GraduateFinancial Aids Office. The form used to request a PTA is located here (http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/pta-initiation-and-setup#early-pta-setup). \nd. Early Accounts\nFor the effective and economical conduct of a sponsored project, it is sometimes necessary for costs to be incurredbefore the award document has been received. In such cases, departments should request that OSR set up an earlyPTA. The \"Authorization for Early Project Task and Award Request\" form is available online here(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/how-to/open-early-pta).The early PTA becomes the permanent PTA when theaward is effective; no cost transfers are needed. Pre-award costs must be charged to a pre-award account and maynot be placed on an unrelated award and later transferred to the benefiting PTA.\ne. Ongoing PTA Management\n(1) Allowability of Expenditures\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) is accountable for the accuracy, allowability, allocability, appropriateness and timelyreview of charges to a grant or contract PTA (or a related cost sharing PTA) and for ensuring that expenditures donot exceed the level authorized by the award. See Guide Memos:\n3.1.4 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-management/cost-policy): CostPolicy3.2.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/expenditure-management/responsibility-university-funds): Authorizing Expenditures3.2.2 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/expenditure-management/cost-transfers): Cost Transfers3.2.3 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/expenditure-management/allocations-and-offsets): Allocations and Offsets\n(2) Approvals\nThe terms of the award and governing cost principles may require approval from the agency for such actions asrebudgeting funds, travel, or purchasing capital equipment. OSR processes approval requests.\n(3) Review\nThe PI or someone else knowledgeable about the sponsored project must review the PTA each month, bringing anyquestionable items to the PI for decision on any needed action. Review guidance and tools are available atDoResearch (http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/project-management/monthly-review-and-quarterly-pi-review-and-certification). The review is evidenced by a signature on the monthly expenditure report.\n(4) Suballocations\nA suballocation of a grant or contract may be set up to handle accounting for:\nA subcontractSeparate portions of the workFabrication of capital equipment\nA conference associated with the project: This is usually accomplished by setting up additional Tasks within theProject, linked to the appropriate award(s).\nf. Fiscal Year End\nAccounting records for grant and contract PTAs are closed for reporting purposes at fiscal year end. The entirebudget and all expenditures for the period of the award are carried forward to the new fiscal year expenditurereports.\ng. Closing a Grant or Contract PTA\n(1) Definition\nCloseout is the administrative process whereby sponsors determine whether all technical and administrativerequirements of the grant or contract have been completed. Sponsored projects are considered completed or\"closed out\" only after the sponsor receives and approves all technical, financial, invention and property reports asrequired by the terms and conditions of the award and notifies Stanford of its acceptance and signoff.\n(2) Principal Investigator's Responsibilities\nAt the close of",

    "text": ", invention and property reports asrequired by the terms and conditions of the award and notifies Stanford of its acceptance and signoff.\n(2) Principal Investigator's Responsibilities\nAt the close of a grant or contract, the Principal Investigator is accountable for ensuring that the expenses recordedare complete, allowable, allocable, and without overdrafts. For more information, see Guide Memo 3.2.2(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/expenditure-management/cost-transfers): CostTransfers, and the Research Policy Handbook 15.8 (https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/financial-aspects-sponsored-projects-administration/cost-transfer-policy-sponsored-projects) CostTransfer Policy for Sponsored Projects.\n(3) Office of Sponsored Research Responsibilities\nOSR prepares the final financial reports and performs a review. Generally, the final financial report is due 90 daysafter the end of the award.\n3. Cost-Sharing PTA\na. Purpose\nCost sharing represents that portion of the total project costs of a sponsored agreement borne by the University,rather than the sponsor. The Research Policy Handbook 15.3 (https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/financial-aspects-sponsored-projects-administration/cost-sharing-policy) states the University'spolicy on cost sharing. Separate PTAs must be established to track committed cost sharing. This is usuallyaccomplished by setting up a cost sharing Task in the Project that holds the sponsored project, and linking it to acost-sharing award.\nb. Source of Funds\nThe Principal Investigator must identify and provide resources to fund the cost-sharing PTA. Funds from otherfederal awards may not be used as the source of cost sharing except as authorized by statute. Funds generallycome from unrestricted, gift, endowment income, or designated funds.\nc. Setting Up\nThe notice of award prepared by OSR and the signed award document indicate if the project involves cost sharing.OSR will not open the sponsored PTA until the related cost-sharing PTA is opened. When a cost-sharing PTA isrequired, a person with signature authority over the fund from which the cost-sharing PTA will be funded orguaranteed sends a copy of the cost-sharing budget and the Cost-Sharing Authorization form to OSR requesting thePTA be opened. For information on how to set up a sponsored PTA, see the DoResearch(http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/pta-initiation-and-setup#cost-sharing-pta-setup) website.\nd. Ongoing PTA Management\nCost-sharing PTAs are subject to the same PTA management procedures as described above for grant and contractPTAs.\ne. Fiscal Year End\nCost-sharing PTAs must be fully funded at the end of the University's fiscal year. Cost-sharing budgets andexpenditures carry over to the new fiscal year, as described above for grant and contract PTAs.\nf. Closing a Cost Sharing PTA\nThe cost-sharing PTA is closed at the same time as the related grant or contract account, as described above.\n4. Gift PTA\na. Purpose\nA gift PTA is used to record the expenditures that execute the purpose of the gift.\nb. Source of Funds\nThe source of money for a gift fund may be a single gift or multiple gifts that have a common purpose and anyrelated income generated by the gift itself or its associated endowment.\nc. Setting Up\nWhen a gift is received whose terms require the opening of a separate fund, the Department submits the FundAccounting PTA Request form via email to their school/department Fund Accountant in the Controller's Office. Theymust also fax copies of the donor documentation and a Gift Transmittal Form to their fund accountant. The originaldonor correspondence regarding the restricted purpose of the gift and the original Gift Transmittal along with thedonor check should be sent to Gift Processing. Never hold a donor check while waiting for a PTA. Fund Accounting,in consultation with the school, assigns a fund/award number and sets up the related expenditure Project andTask(s). Fund Accounting creates the Fund Authorization document that describes the purpose of the fund. If the giftcreates a new endowment fund, Fund Accounting sets up a related expendable endowment income fund to receivethe endowment income. The form used to request a new Gift PTA is located at here(http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/pta-initiation-and-setup#forms-to-setup-or-modify-existing-ptas).\nFor step-by-step instructions, see Quick Steps: Request New PTA(http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/acctstructure/quick_steps/request_newPTA.html).\nd. Fiscal Year End\nAt fiscal year end the balance of the gift fund automatically carries over into the new year. If expenditures exceedavailable funds in an expendable gift fund or an endowment income fund, a transfer from another appropriate fundrestricted to departmental use must cover the overdraft. Consult with your fund accountant for the appropriateaccount to use.\ne. Closing a Gift PTA\n(1) Endowment\nEndowment gift funds and their related endowment income funds are very seldom closed. In the event that a PTAfunded by an endowment income fund needs to be closed, the department should contact Fund Accounting. Theaccount will be closed the first of the next month.\n(2) Expendable Gift PTAs\nAt any time during the year, departments may send a memo to Fund Accounting requesting that a PTA for anexpendable gift fund be closed to expense. The memo should include the reason for closing the PTA. The PTA willbe closed as of the first of the month following the month in which the memo is received, unless otherwisestipulated.\n5. Designated Funds and Related PTA\na. Purpose\nDesignated funds generally contain unrestricted funds that the University (rather than a donor or sponsoring agency)has decided to use for a specific purpose.\nb. Source of Funds\nThere are two sorts of designated funds:(1) General funds that have been transferred to a department for a specificpurpose, such as departmental research support.(2) Income that has been generated by the department anddesignated for departmental use. Examples are fees from professional services and conferences.\nc. Setting Up\nTo open a designated fund and related expenditure account, the department sends an email and Fund AccountingPTA Request Form to their school/department Fund Accounting. The form used to request a new PTA is locatedhere (http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/pta-initiation-and-setup#forms-to-setup-or-modify-existing-ptas).  Fund Accounting, in consultation with the school, assigns a fund (award) number and sets up therelated Project and Task(s) with the Fund Authorization information. For step-by-step instructions, see Quick Steps:Request New PTA (http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/acctstructure/quick_steps/request_newPTA.html).\nd. Changes to Fund Balances\n1. Designated funds funded by general funds transfers are increased only by transfers from other Universitydesignated or unrestricted funds. That is, income cannot be deposited to this kind of fund.2. Designated funds holding income are increased as cash receipts are deposited or transferred from otherUniversity designated or unrestricted funds.\ne. Fiscal Year End\nAt fiscal year end the balance of the designated fund automatically carries over into the new year. If expendituresexceed available funds in a designated fund, a transfer from another appropriate fund must cover the overdraft.Consult with your fund accountant for the appropriate account to use.\nf. Closing a Designated Fund PTA\nAt any time during the year, the department may send an email to Fund Accounting requesting that a P, T, and/or Afor a designated fund be closed to expense. The memo should include the reason for closing the PTA. The PTA willbe closed as of the first of the month following the month in which the memo is received, unless otherwisestipulated.\n6.

Purpose\nCapital Asset projects capture expenditures related to facilities and infrastructure projects or computer hardware orsoftware systems that require capitalization. They allow the University to categorize expenditures as capital assetsor expenses and to collect expenditures in a way that supports indirect cost recovery, service center ratedevelopment and financial reporting.\nb. Source of Funds\nMultiple sources of funding may support a specific capital project. Examples are gifts, departmental funds, Universityunrestricted funds, University facilities reserves, debt, and Stanford Infrastructure Program funds.\nc. Setting Up\nA department planning a facilities construction or renovation project works with  Land, Buildings and Real Estate(http://lbre.stanford.edu/cap_plan/) (LBRE)/Department of Capital Planning to initiate the project via the FacilitiesForm 1 System (http://lbre.stanford.edu/cap_plan/form_1_system). When the project receives approval, a copy ofthe Facilities Form I and PTA set-up form is submitted to the Capital Accounting section of the Controller's Office.Capital Accounting reviews the Form 1 for necessary approvals, appropriateness of sources of funding and fundavailability. It also sets up the PTA and sends out an Authorization memo, which includes the appropriate capitalPTA, authorized budget, and applicable asset code for the project, notifying the appropriate individuals so they cangrant signature authority on the PTA, as needed. For step-by-step instructions, see Quick Steps: Request New PTA(http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/acctstructure/quick_steps/request_newPTA.html).\nFor capital asset projects that do not involve facilities (e.g., computer hardware or software systems) the CapitalProjects PTA Request Form (http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/acctstructure/forms.html) should be completed and sentto Capital Accounting.\nd. Mid-Project Changes\nIf changes are needed to source of funds, the department informs Capital Accounting. Once funds are committed viathe Form I, the department may not withdraw the funding commitment. However, a substitution of one fund sourcefor another can be made.\ne. Fiscal Year End\nAt fiscal year end the entire budget and expenditures for the project are carried forward to the new fiscal yearexpenditure statements. Expenditures must be fully funded. The department must work with Capital Accountingthroughout the year to cover overdrafts.\nf. Closing a Capital Project\nThe project manager informs Capital Accounting that a project has been completed. Capital Accounting reconcilesoutstanding commitments, closes the project and award, and returns any unexpended funds to their original source.\n7. Student Aid PTA\nA student aid PTA is a special kind of PTA used to record departmental expenditures for student aid from currentfunds. Student aid PTAs are set up and managed in the same way as Operating Budget, gift, or designated PTAs,depending on the source of funds. See Quick Steps: Request New PTA(http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/acctstructure/quick_steps/request_newPTA.html).\nNote: Salaries to student employees and graduate research and teaching assistant tuition allowance are notstudent aid.\n8. Auxiliary PTA\na. Purpose\nAuxiliary enterprises are self-supporting entities that support the University's teaching and research mission. Theyservice principally faculty, students, staff and the Stanford community. Major University auxiliaries include Housingand Dining Services, Stanford University Press, and the Department of Athletics.\nb. Source of Funds\nThe source of funds for auxiliary PTAs is the income generated by the auxiliary activity. The amount budgeted for thefiscal year is based on a forecast of expected income and expenses for the year.\nc. Setting Up\nTo set up a new auxiliary account, the department sends a memo to Fund Accounting with the appropriateinformation. The Fund Accounting PTA Request form is located here(http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/acctstructure/forms.html). \nd. PTA Management\nAuxiliaries are managed similarly to a business enterprise. In addition to income and expense activities, they mayhave assets, liabilities, and reserve (fund) PTAs.\ne. Fiscal Year End\nAny surplus or deficit is transferred at year-end to a reserve PTA of the auxiliary.\nf. Closing an Auxiliary P, T, and / or A\nAt any time during the year, the auxiliary may send a memo to Fund Accounting requesting that a P, T, and/or A forthe auxiliary be closed. The memo should include the reason for closing the account. The PTA will be closed as ofthe first of the month following the month in which the memo is received, unless otherwise stipulated.\n9. Service Center PTA\na. Purpose\nA service center is an organizational unit of the University that provides a specific service, group of services, orproducts to users principally within the University. Large service centers include Information Technology Services(ITS), Land, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE), and the Medical School's Veterinary Service Center. Smaller servicecenters are typically found within academic departments. Detailed information on Service Centers is available atDoResearch (https://doresearch.stanford.edu/office/office-research-administration-research-administration-policy-and-compliance).\nb. Authorization\nProposals for a new service center must have the approval of the department chair and school dean, or theirequivalent for nonacademic areas. The Office of Research Administration Policy and Compliance (RAPC) isresponsible for setting service center policy and reviewing annual budget submissions which should include thevolume projection for services, and ensure the costs are compliant with Federal as well as University regulations.Review the Service Center Manual (http://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/service-center-manual) for additionalinformation.\nc. Annual Breakeven\nAll service centers must annually break even, unless ONR has granted an exception. Twelve months of operationalexpense should be allocated to users via twelve months of allocation journals. If the year-end under-recoveryexceeds 5% of expenses including the prior year balance for administrative service centers or 15% for academicservice centers then either the users are charged the under-recovered amount or the service center's departmentwill need to subsidize the entire loss. If the year-end over-recovery exceeds the 5% or 15% limit, a rebate must beallocated to all users of the service center. The breakeven calculation is fully explained here(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/service-center-manual/policies-and-practices/service-center-policies). \nd. Source of Funds\nThe costs of service center services or products are charged directly to all users based on the actual level of activityusing a nondiscriminatory rate schedule. This rate schedule (the service center rate) must be calculated to recoverno more or no less than the estimated aggregate cost of the service or product over a fiscal year unless otherwiseagreed upon by the federal government.\ne. Setting Up\nWhen a new service center is reviewed and approved by RAPC, RAPC will open a new PTA. Some of theinformation required to open a new service center includes the purpose of the service center, anticipated usage, listof anticipated internal and external users, estimated initial budget, list of capital assets that will be required for theservice center operation and a valid Guarantee PTA account. All academic service centers must have a guaranteeaccount, which can be an operating budget, Dean's Executive fund, or unrestricted gift PTA designated by theschool dean or department head. See the \"Request for Establishing a New Service Center(http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/acctstructure/quick_steps/request_newPTA.html#request_service_ctr)\"PTA setup document.\nf.

    "text": "Service Center(http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/acctstructure/quick_steps/request_newPTA.html#request_service_ctr)\"PTA setup document.\nf. Mid-Year Changes\nRequests to change a service center rate should be made as soon as it appears an administrative service center willnot break even within +/-5% at year-end or an academic service center will not break even within +/-15% at year-end using the previously approved rates. Such requests much be routed to the appropriate service center analyst forreview and approval before the new rate can be used. A list of service center analysts(http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-offices/research-administration-policy-and-compliance-rapc#service-centers) is available online.\ng. Fiscal Year End\nService center balances at fiscal year end must be within +/- 5% of an administrative service center's annualexpenditures, including the prior year balance and +/- 15% of an academic service center's annual expenditures,including prior year balances. When any over-recovery exceeds break-even percentage, the entire surplus balancemust be refunded to all users in an equitable manner. When any under-recovery exceeds the applicable percentage,the entire deficit balance must be cleared either by either charging the service center's Guarantee PTA or byallocating a yearend assessment of the entire loss to all users on a prorated usage basis. Service centers thatoperate under special long-term break-even or pricing agreements with the government will not be required to breakeven at year-end.\nh. Closing a Service Center PTA\nThe department will need to clear any remaining balance before RAPC can close the service center PTA.\n10. Expenditure Allocation PTA\na. Purpose\nAn expenditure allocation (expense clearing) PTA is a departmental expenditure PTA used to accumulate specificcosts as a means of expediting the processing of accounting transactions. Expenditure allocation PTAs are usedwhen the final distribution of expenses is unknown at the time the expenses are incurred. Expenditure allocationPTAs are cleared via iJournals or Labor Distribution adjustments. Labor and material costs cannot be combined inthe same expenditure allocation PTA. If labor and material expenses must be combined, the department shouldestablish a service center PTA (see section 9). For related information, see AGM 3.2.3: Allocation and Offsets(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/expenditure-management/allocations-and-offsets). Please refer to the DoResearch (http://doresearch.stanford.edu/)site for additional guidance on the use ofexpenditure allocation PTAs.\nb. Authorization\nExpenditure allocation PTAs must have the approval of the requesting department's Administrative Service Managerand an individual with financial authority over the guarantee PTA.\nc. Source of Funds\nThe requesting department must identify and provide resources to guarantee the expenditure allocation PTA. Fundsfrom sponsored awards may not be used as the guarantee. Guarantees generally come from unrestricted, gift,endowment income, or designated funds. The fund source will be used to guarantee any uncleared expenses at theend of the fiscal year.\nd. Setting Up\nWhen a department needs a new expenditure allocation PTA it requests Research Administration Policy andCompliance (RAPC) to set it up by submitting the Request For Expenditure Allocation PTA form(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/documents/expenditure-allocation-pta-request-form/download). RAPC will reviewthe allocation method(s) to be used by the account administrator and maintain records to support the establishmentof the PTA.\n11. Receivables PTA\nA department that administers a program such as a conference or professional journal sponsored by an organizationoutside the University must use a receivables PTA for expenses incurred on campus. Operating budgets, designatedfunds and restricted funds cannot be used for such activities. To open a receivables account, contact theReceivables Accounting section of the Controller's Office.\n12. Account Maintenance\nCertain information gathered at the time the account is established may change over time. The information includesthe Owner, Manager and Owning-Organization of the Project, Task and Award. This information is crucial toreporting on and analyzing financial activity and may impact authority and approvals. When a change occurs due toturnover or business reorganization the department must update PTA roles and owning, as described at Stanford'sGateway to Financial Activities (https://fingate.stanford.edu/system/pta-manager). \n \nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-management/expenditure-accounts-ptas",

    "text": "3.1.4 Cost Policy\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer.\nLast Updated\nJuly 26, 2022\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 34.5\nThis Guide Memo outlines general policies on expense reimbursement by the federal\ngovernment and discusses the importance of assigning the correct Project, Task and Award\n(PTA) and Expenditure Type to expenses and credits. For more detailed information, see\nPurpose and Use of Expenditure Type Codes (https://fingate.stanford.edu/account-\nstructure/purpose-and-use-expenditure-type-codes) on the Gateway to Financial Activities\nwebsite.  \n1. Background\nAbout a quarter of all funding for University expenditures comes from the federal government.\nMost of this funding comes in the form of direct support for sponsored projects, but a substantial\nportion comes in the form of reimbursement for indirect costs of federally sponsored grants and\ncontracts. Stanford tracks whether University activities are allowable for reimbursement using the\nProject, Task and Award (PTA) to which transactions are charged, and tracks allowable and\nunallowable cost objects through the Expenditure Type used to record transactions.\nEmployees responsible for reviewing and approving expenditure transactions must be granted\nfinancial approval authority in Authority Manager and complete required training.  Training covers\nall key responsibilities of financial transaction approvers, including expectations relative to\nsponsored projects. For more information, see Financial Transaction Approval\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/authority/financial-transaction-approval) on Stanford’s Gateway to\nFinancial Activities website.\n2. Definitions\nDirect Costs are expenses that can be identified specifically with a particular sponsored project\nor other direct cost objective, such as Auxiliary Activities or Instruction, or expenses that can be\ndirectly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy.\nExample: cost of materials used on a project\nIndirect Costs are those incurred for common or joint objectives and therefore cannot be\nidentified readily with a particular sponsored project. Indirect costs are sometimes called Facility\n& Administrative (F&A) or overhead costs.\nExample: costs of buildings or utilities\n3. General Rules\nRules for allowability are covered in the government document OMB Circular A-21\n(https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/circulars_a021_2004/) and the Uniform Guidance\n(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/glossary-term/uniform-guidance). In many cases, the issue of\nwhether a particular cost is allowable is a complex one. When in doubt, consult with your local\nfinancial or research administrator, the Office of Sponsored Research or Research Financial\nCompliance and Services (RFCS). All unallowable activities and objects (line items) must be\ncoded as such. In general, expenses are chargeable to the federal government only if they are:\nReasonable: A prudent person would have purchased this item and paid this price.\nAllocable: Expenses can be allocated to the government activity based on benefit derived,\ncause and effect, or other equitable relationship.\nConsistently Treated: Like expenses must be treated the same in like circumstances.\nAllowable: Allowable for reimbursement as specified by government regulations.\nIf an expense cannot meet the above criteria, it is not eligible to be charged to a federal grant or\ncontract no matter what its purpose.\nNote: Agencies that sponsor grants and contracts use the term allowable to mean permitted as a\ndirect cost under the terms of a specific grant or contract. Expenses that are generally allowable\nfor federal reimbursement may not necessarily be permitted under the terms of a specific grant\nor contract.\n4. Unallowable Costs\nExpenses that are unallowable for federal reimbursement as a direct or indirect cost may still be\nreasonable and necessary business expenses permitted by the University, as outlined in the\nAdministrative Guide. Departments may incur these expenses, but they must be coded as\nunallowable so they can be readily identified and excluded from the indirect cost calculation. A\ndetailed list of specifically unallowable activities (Tasks) and objects (Expenditure Types) is\nprovided in theUnderstanding Cost Policy course\n(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/training/research-administration). \nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-\nmanagement/cost-policy",

    "text": "3.1.5 Retention of Financial Records\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer.\nLast Updated\nJune 15, 2012\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 34.4\nThis Guide Memo covers time requirements for retaining financial records and security\nrequirements for disposing of old records.\n1. Purpose of Record Retention\nRetaining records serves two purposes. In the short-term, it provides those responsible for the\nmanagement of accounts with the means to monitor transactions and resolve problems. In the\nlong-term, it enables the University to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Internal\nRevenue Service regulations, and other federal, state and local regulations governing auditability\nand retention of records.\n2. Responsibility\na. Online Transactions\nWhen the source documentation for a transaction is online, the central administrative office\nresponsible for maintaining the online application is responsible for retaining the online\ntransaction record.\nb. Paper Documents\nWhen the source documentation for a transaction is paper, the office that receives the original\ndocument is responsible for retaining it. The submitting department is responsible for retaining\nthe support until the transaction has posted to the monthly expenditure report. Originating\ndepartments have the responsibility to destroy any paper backup once central administration has\nsuccessfully processed the reimbursement request, has a copy of the scanned supporting\ndocumentation and the transaction has posted to the monthly expenditure report.\nExceptions:\n1. For Federal contracts, a copy of the original paper copy must be retained for one year past\nthe date it was scanned;\n2. either a paper copy or scanned copy of the monthly grant and contract expenditure\nstatements or quarterly certification statement signed by the principal investigator and task\nmanager should be retained by the department in accordance with the \"Direct Charges and\nRevenues to Contracts and Grants\" retention policy.\n3. Retention Times\na. Minimum Paper and Electronic Record Retention TimesLegal and Audit\nRequirements\nWhen requirements for long-term retention of records overlap, the responsible office should\nretain records for the maximum period needed to meet legal and audit requirements. In special\ncases retention times may be extended by request of the central offices. In such a situation the\naffected will be notified in writing. General rules:\nTax-Exempt Debt Related Records: Life of the bond issue, plus the life of any issue that\nrefunds the issue, plus six years. Records related to tax-exempt debt include but are not\nlimited to documentation of the use of the debt proceeds (project costs), how debt financed\nproperty is used, relevant sponsored research contracts and grants in facilities financed\nwith tax-exempt debt, relevant third party leases of space, etc. Detailed information can be\nfound under the Compliance Guidelines for Tax-Exempt Bonds\n(http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/docs/bond_taxExempt_guidelines.pdf). \nDirect Charges and Revenues to Contracts and Grants: Four years following the end\ndate of the award (longer if circumstances related to tax-exempt financing require it, see\nTax-Exempt Debt Related Records above).\nTransactions involving depreciable assets:\nMoveable equipment records (not financed with tax-exempt debt) will be centrally\nretained three years beyond the disposal of the asset.\nTransaction records involving other depreciable assets will be retained six years\nbeyond the asset becoming fully depreciated (longer if circumstances related to tax-\nexempt financing require it, see Tax-Exempt Debt Related Records above.)\nBusiness Transaction Records (not contract or grant-related): Four years.\nEmployee Payroll Information: Six years from retirement or termination.\nTaxable Income (Cash receipt information and billings, and all documents for activities\nconsidered unrelated business income. See Guide Memo 1.5.3\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/conflict-\ninterest/unrelated-business-activity): Unrelated Business Activity). Four years following the\nend of the fiscal year. Longer retention times apply to certain documents retained by central\noffices. For information on a specific document or category of documents, the office\nresponsible for the type of transaction should consult the Office of Sponsored Research\n(OSR), Research Financial Compliance and Services, or Financial Management Services\n(FMS) consisting of the Controller's Office, Office of the Treasurer, Procurement (including\nAccounts Payable, Travel & Reimbursements), Global Services, and Consulting & Support.\nb. Management Information\nWhen a central office has retention responsibility, the department initiating a transaction may\ndiscard copies of documentation supporting the transaction when it is no longer needed for\nmanagement purposes. For example, when the transaction is complete and the expenditure\nstatement containing the transaction has been reviewed. At its discretion, a department may\nkeep copies of documents for longer periods.\n4. Disposal of Old Documents\nTo safeguard the privacy of individuals, documents that contain salary information must be\nshredded, incinerated, or otherwise disposed of securely. Departments may arrange for service\nfrom a business record destruction vendor.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-\nmanagement/retention-financial-records",

    "text": "3.1.6 Charitable Donations by Stanford\nUniversity to Other Charitable Organizations\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer.\nLast Updated\nDecember 6, 2021\nEffective Date\nDecember 5, 2014\nThis memo describes the limited circumstances when a charitable donation may be made by\nStanford to an outside organization.\n1. Policy Statement\nStanford University is a non-profit public charity that receives its funds from sponsors, donors, \nparents/students and others in furtherance of our educational, research and patient care\nmissions. Accordingly, provision of University funds to other US charitable institutions as\ndonations is highly restricted. When considering support of another charitable organization,\nStanford personnel must first consider whether the objective should be achieved through a\ncontractual arrangement or other form of written understanding with the potential recipient\ninstitution, spelling out services and deliverables that align with Stanford’s purposes. Coordinate\nwith the Office of Community Engagement to assess potential collaboration opportunities, as\nneeded.\nAll approved donations from Stanford are limited to US charities with current Internal Revenue\nCode (IRC) Section 501(c)(3) status. No donor funds or sponsor-restricted funds may be used in\nsupport of other charitable organizations. \n2. When Donations to Other Charitable Organizations Are\nPermissible\na. A donation may only be made at the direction of the President, the Provost, the Vice\nPresident for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer, or the Chief External Relations\nOfficer.\nb. A donation may be made to the charity of the family’s choice in the case of the death of an\nemployee or a member of their immediate family, in lieu of customary flowers (Limit: $100).\nc. Upon recommendation by a donor, a donation may be made from the portion of their donor-\nadvised fund available for such designation. Recipient charities must be vetted and\napproved by senior management of the Office of Development.\n3. Exceptions to Policy\nExceptions to the policy are rare. The Office of Community Engagement (OCE) and the Office of\nGovernment Affairs (OGA), under the direction of the Chief External Relations Officer and in\nclose coordination with related offices, will respond to inquiries about exceptions and guide the\nuniversity’s response to external community requests.  \nFollowing review, requests for exception must be approved by the Vice President for Business\nAffairs and Chief Financial Officer or the Chief External Relations Officer. Requests should state:\na. How and over what period Stanford-provided funds would be spent by the intended\nrecipient.\nb. What  Stanford goals would be achieved by the donation.\nc. Why such goals could not be achieved through any other form of relationship with the\ncharity.\nd. That the recipient will provide written acknowledgement of the funding, certify that the funds\nwere used for Stanford’s intended purpose and detail what results were achieved.\ne. A description of the intended recipient charity and proof of its tax-exempt status.\nThe Offices of the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer and the Chief\nExternal Relations Officer will annually create a list of such donations for each fiscal year,\nincluding the name, address, Federal Employer Identification Number and Section of the Internal\nRevenue Code under which the organization is granted tax-exemption (typically IRC Section 501\n(c)(3)), and the amount of cash or extent of property being donated for any recipient of more than\n$5,000 from the university within that year. A copy of this list is to be forwarded to the Tax\nDepartment within Financial Management Services to include this information on Stanford’s\nannual Form 990 filing with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-\nmanagement/charitable-donations-stanford-university-other",

    "text": "3.2.1 Responsibility for University Funds\nAuthorityApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs & Chief Financial Officer.Last UpdatedJuly 26, 2022\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 36\nThis Guide Memo describes responsibilities for the management of funds in University Projects, Tasks andAwards (PTAs).\n1. Responsibility for University Funds\na. University Officers' Responsibility\nDeans, department chairs, directors, principal investigators, and other University officials are responsible forthe management of funds in their PTAs. See Guide Memo 1.2.1(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/university-organization/university-organization): University Organization. These individuals have the authority to expend these funds toaccomplish their assigned responsibilities, and are responsible for assuring that expenditures charged to theirPTAs are:\nReasonable and necessaryConsistent with established University policies and practices applicable to the work of the University,including instruction, research, and public serviceConsistent with sponsor or donor expenditure restrictions\nFor more information on cost policy, see Guide Memo 3.1.4(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-management/cost-policy): CostPolicy.\nb. Delegation of Authority\nAuthority to sign expenditure documents for the purchase of services and materials on a PTA may bedelegated and the University official may authorize the person to whom authority is delegated to furtherdelegate signature authority. The University official retains accountability for prudent control of the PTA. TheUniversity official may place limits on the dollar level and the types of expenditures for which signatureauthority is delegated. For more information on authorization procedures, review and error correctionprocedures, and expenditures of restricted funds, please see the Financial Authority(http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/finauthority/index.html) section of the Gateway to FinancialActivities (http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/index.html) website.\n2. Authorization Procedures\na. Authority and Required Training\nEmployees responsible for reviewing and approving expenditure transactions must be granted financialapproval authority in Authority Manager and complete required training. Training covers all key responsibilitiesof financial transaction approvers, including expectations relative to sponsored projects. For more information,see Financial Transaction Approval (https://fingate.stanford.edu/authority/financial-transaction-approval) onStanford’s Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nb. Delegation of Signature Authority\n(1) University Officials\nA letter from University officials indicating the organization for which they are responsible and theadministrator to whom they have delegated the ability to manage authority must be on file with FinancialManagement Services.\n(2) Delegation of Signature Authority\nTo delegate authority for both electronic and paper form transactions, the person responsible for theorganization or PTA must delegate such authority via the Authority Manager.\nc. Electronic Signature\nUsers of campus financial systems identify themselves to these systems using approved, secureauthentication methods. See Guide Memo 6.4.1(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/computing/identification-and-authentication/identification-and-authentication-systems): Identification and Authentication Systems, for details on these methods. In additionto these system-independent authentication methods, financial systems may have system-specificauthentication methods (e.g., a username and password for a particular system). Regardless of theauthentication method, authentication using any of the approved methods is the electronic equivalent of anemployee's hand-written signature and may be used as an \"electronic signature\" in electronic applications.\nd. Signature Security\nOnly the person to whom authority is delegated may authorize a transaction either manually or electronically.Disciplinary steps will be taken against individuals who are found to have fraudulently signed the name ofanother person, used the authentication information of another person, or divulged their authenticationinformation to another person. The possible disciplinary actions for violations, which can include termination ofemployment or student status, will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. User responsibilitiesfor handling authentication information are described in Guide Memo 6.4.1(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/computing/identification-and-authentication/identification-and-authentication-systems): Identification and Authentication Systems.\ne. Limitations on Signature Authority\n(1) Expense Reimbursement\nNo person may approve their own expense reimbursement, or the expense reimbursement of an individual towhom their reports either directly or indirectly. Expense reimbursements, which require two signatures, musthave the signatures of the person incurring the expense and the person responsible for the management ofthe PTA or a properly delegated agent.\n(2) Independent Review\nBusiness expenses incurred by or on behalf of the President, the Provost, a direct report to the President orthe Provost, or the senior financial officer of the academic units must be approved by an independentreviewer designated by the CFO. Expenses for ordinary supplies, customarily available for all employees inan office, should be approved by a local business official and need not be routed for independent review.\n(3) Salaries\nNo person may sign any payroll/personnel form that affects their own salary, or payroll/personnel forms thataffect the salary of an individual to whom their reports either directly or indirectly.\n(4) Conflict of Interest\nNo person may authorize payment to any individual or business where there is a conflict of interest. SeeGuide Memo 1.5.2 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/conflict-interest/staff-policy-conflict-commitment-and): Staff Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest.\nf. Revoking Signature Authority\nThe University official who delegated authority (or the person who currently holds that position) is responsibleto ensure granted authority reflects the unit's current needs. When a person with signature authority transfers\nto another department or leaves the University, their authority is automatically revoked. Changes for otheroperational reasons can be made at any time through the Authority Manager. For more information, see QuickSteps: Grant, Change, Revoke or Restore Financial Authority to Others(http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/finauthority/quick_steps/grant_revoke_auth.html) on theGateway to Financial Activities (http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/finauthority/index.html) website.\n3. Review and Error Correction\na. Departmental Review\nThe deans, department chairs, directors, principal investigators and other University officials to whom fundsare allocated are responsible for reviewing their expense transactions and monthly expenditure/operatingstatements to assure that:\nAny expenditure is necessary and for University purposes.Charges are correct.Charges are allowable for the PTA.Charges are correctly coded as allowable or unallowable for inclusion in the University's indirect costrate calculations.Charges are allocable to the PTA (i.e., necessary to achieve objectives of the project).Any allocation of costs is reasonable and equitable.Charges are appropriately documented, and are recorded in a consistent manner within departmentalaccounts.\nb. Evidence of Review\nReview of transactions is evidenced by a manual or electronic signature in the appropriate field of the form.\nc. Responsibility for Error Correction\nThe department is responsible for correction of errors. Time limits for error correction are outlined in GuideMemo 3.2.2 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapt",

Time limits for error correction are outlined in GuideMemo 3.2.2 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/expenditure-management/cost-transfers): Cost Transfers, and the Research Policy Handbook 15.3,(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/financial-aspects-sponsored-projects-administration/cost-sharing-policy)  Cost Sharing Policy. Occasionally errors are found after the regular timelimits for correction. Regardless of when the error is found, the University officer whose PTA used the good orservice must pay for it, either from the same or another appropriate PTA.\nd. Central Office Review\nTo supplement (but not replace) the University official's basic review responsibility, Financial ManagementServices (including Procurement and the Controller's Office) and the Office of Sponsored Research reviewUniversity selected expense transactions. If incorrect or improper charges are found, the reviewing officedirects the person responsible for the expenditures to correct the error. If necessary, the reviewing office maycorrect the department's error and will provide the department with a copy of the accounting entry.\n4. Expenditures of Restricted Funds\na. Conformity to External Restrictions — Sponsored Research\nExpenditures of restricted funds, such as organized research or gift funds, whether from federal or non-federal sources, must conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in the agreement (e.g., grant orcooperative agreement). Expenditures of funds for federally sponsored projects are subject to the allowability,allocability, and reasonableness standards of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) UniformAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (2 CFR 200,Uniform Guidance), and the negotiated agreements between the University and the federal government.Please see the DoResearch (https://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-offices/office-sponsored-research-osr)website for more information: http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/major-topics/uniform-guidance-concepts-are-changing (http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/major-topics/uniform-guidance-concepts-are-changing)Cost-sharing tasks are subject to the same standards as thesponsored project that they support.\nb. Monthly Review of Charges\nFor sponsored projects and related cost-sharing tasks, the expenditure statements must be reviewed eachmonth, as noted in Guide Memo 3.1.3 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-management/expenditure-accounts-ptas): Expenditure Accounts (PTA). The reviewshould include areas such as those covered by the Monthly Review Guidance and Monthly Reconciliationtools. The review is evidenced by a signature on the monthly expenditure statement. The review must becompleted within two months of the end of the month of the statement (e.g., October expenditures must bereviewed no later than December 31). Principal Investigators may delegate monthly review of expenditures,but may not delegate the Quarterly Certification of Charges (see paragraph 4.c).\nc. Quarterly Certification of Charges\nThe following certification of direct costs is preprinted on expenditure statements for sponsored projects andcost-sharing tasks each month:\n\"I have reviewed the three months of expenditures for this quarter. To the best of my knowledge, allexpenditures are appropriate. Where required, corrections have been or will be made through the accountingsystem. I understand that to be considered timely all corrections must be made within two months of the lastday of month being reviewed.\nPRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR'S\nSignature___________________________Date_____________ \nPROJECT TASK MANAGER’S\nSignature___________________________Date_____________\"\nQuarterly certification is the responsibility of the project Principal Investigator (or Co-PI). A PI may delegatethe monthly review of statements for accuracy, but may not delegate certification of the appropriateness ofthe charges. This certification statement must be signed by the principal investigator and the project taskmanager. Only the last expenditure statement for the academic quarter must be signed by the principalinvestigator and Project Task Manager. The quarterly certification must be completed within two months of theend of the academic quarter being certified, as described in the Monthly Review and Quarterly PI ReviewCertification (http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/project-management/monthly-review-and-quarterly-pi-review-and-certification). This signature means that the principal investigator has reviewed alldirect charges to the project and that either the charges on the expenditure statement are reasonablyaccurate as shown, or that the appropriate individual in the department has initiated accounting entries tocorrect any differences. Review and correction of differences must be completed within the deadlines outlinedon the DoResearch (http://doresearch.stanford.edu)site.\nd. Record Retention\nThe certified expenditure statements must be retained in the department files for future review by governmentand University auditors in accordance with University record retention requirements for sponsored projects(see Guide Memo 3.1.5 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-management/retention-financial-records): Retention of Financial Records.\n5. Expenditures of Gifts\na. Conformity to Donor Restrictions — Gifts\nGifts, which typically differ from sponsored projects in that they do not require a detailed scope of work,budget, or period of performance, may on occasion have restrictions on the use of funds (to ensure the use isconsistent with the donor’s original, accepted, stipulations). If this is the case, the University must take care toallocate the funds to the academic area, group, department, faculty member or other University activity asstipulated. While the academic area or faculty member may have broad discretion over the specificexpenditures of support, the donor may expect a report on the general uses of funds donated or even a reporton line-item expenses. Donors do not typically recoup gift funds, but if a gift made for a restricted purpose hasnot, however, been spent according to the donor’s restrictions, a donor may have grounds to rescind andrecoup the gifted funds.\nb. Gifts to Stanford made by Faculty, Staff, Spouse or Family member\nTo ensure compliance with regulations governing charitable contributions and to avoid the appearance ofconflict of interest, gifts made to Stanford by Stanford faculty, staff, spouse or family member: \nShould be placed in a unique account so that the source and use of the gifted funds can be clearlyidentified.May not be placed in accounts under the control of the donor (e.g. neither the donor, nor any individualreporting to the donor, may have signature authority over the account).May not be used to fund travel, purchases, or any other expense that could be construed by others tobenefit the donor for purposes unrelated to their work for the University.May not be used to fund the salary of the donor.\n6. Sources for More Information\nCognizant Office\nFinancial Management Services (including Procurement and the Controller's Office) and the ResearchFinancial Compliance and Services (RFCS) office are available to answer questions about expenditureauthorization.

    "text": "3.2.2 Cost Transfers\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer.\nLast Updated\nJuly 26, 2022\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 38\nThis Guide Memo sets out policies and procedures for transferring already incurred costs from\none expenditure account (Project-Task-Award) to another. Cost transfers may also be called\ntransfers of expense.\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to all Stanford employees responsible for financial analysis and management\nof expense transactions.\n1. Cost Transfer Policies\nA cost transfer is an after-the-fact reallocation of the cost associated with a transaction from one\nProject-Task-Award (PTA) to another. Although costs should always be charged to the correct\nPTA, cost transfers are sometimes necessary. To be allowable, cost transfers must be timely, be\nfully documented, conform to University and sponsor allowability standards (that is, allowable\nunder the terms of the sponsored agreement), and have appropriate authorizing signatures. See\nGuide Memo 3.2.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-\nadministration/expenditure-management/responsibility-university-funds): Authorizing\nExpenditures.\na. Error Correction\nCorrection of errors is required on all PTAs. Errors may include clerical errors (such as\ntypographical errors or transposition of digits in the PTA and expenditure types). Other errors\nmay be detected upon review or certification of monthly expenditure reports. It may be that an\nemployee's Labor Schedule was not updated, an individual's effort was redirected, or a purchase\nwas charged to a PTA other than the one that ultimately benefited from the use of the items\npurchased. All errors should be corrected as soon as they are detected.\nb. Active Sponsored Project PTAs\nRefer to Cost Sharing (http://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-\nhandbook/financial-aspects-sponsored-projects-administration/cost-sharing-policy) in the\nResearch Policy Handbook, Section 15.3. In addition to deadlines, it addresses:\nDocumentation\nSponsor requirements\nPre-award costs\nCosts benefiting more than one project\nOverdrafts\nc. Documentation\nOnline cost transfer documentation must clearly show:\nThe expense directly benefits the receiving PTA\nThe expense is allowable on the receiving PTA\nThe reason the expense was charged incorrectly to the first PTA\nThe allocation methodology used if transferring expenses to multiple PTAs\nThat any systematic reasons which might cause this problem to be repeated have been\naddressed\nThe reason for any delay in the timely processing of the transfer\nd. Cost Transfer Deadlines\nCost transfers should be prepared and submitted as soon as the need for a transfer is identified,\nand should be completed no later than six months after the cost is posted. Transfers submitted\nafter the deadline must include a valid reason for the delay, and will generally not be allowed to\nbe transferred onto a sponsored project. When transfers are delayed, a correction to the original\nsource of an entry (e.g., an update to a Labor Schedule) may not be made timely. Therefore,\ncare should also be taken to ensure that subsequent charges are either appropriate to the\noriginal PTA or also transferred.\n2. Cost Transfer Procedures\na. Getting Started\nCost transfers are submitted using the university’s Oracle Financials iJournals and Labor\nDistribution Adjustments systems. For information about accessing and using these systems, see\nLearn About iJournals (https://fingate.stanford.edu/system/ijournals) and Learn About Labor\nDistribution Adjustments (https://fingate.stanford.edu/system/labor-distribution-adjustments) on\nthe Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nNew iJournals are used to transfer all costs with the exception of salary or student aid\nexpenses that were originally posted on or after September 1, 2003\nHistorical iJournals are used to transfer any expenses (including salary and student aid\nexpenses) that were originally posted before September 1, 2003\nSalary iJournals are used to transfer salary expenses originally incurred (determined by the\nexpenditure item date) on or after September 1, 2003 and before April 1, 2005.\nLabor Distribution Adjustments are used to transfer salary expenses originally incurred after\nMarch 31, 2005\nAllocation iJournals are used to distribute costs based on proportional benefit to a project.\nAllocations are used when it is difficult to determine in advance how much to charge each\nPTA for a shared supply or service. Allocations are often used to distribute costs from\nService Centers, Auxiliaries, or expenditure allocation PTAs. Often allocations are\nrepetitive, or are required on a repetitive basis.\nb. Authorization Requirements\nAll users of university financial system must have an active SUNetID and password.\nFinancial transaction preparers and approvers must be granted appropriate authority privileges\nusing the Authority Manager system and complete required training. Training covers all key\nresponsibilities of financial transaction approvers, including expectations relative to sponsored\nprojects. For more information, see Authority to Create Financial Transactions\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/authority/authority-create-financial-transactions) and Financial\nTransaction Approval (https://fingate.stanford.edu/authority/financial-transaction-approval) on\nStanford’s Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nc. Signatures\nOnline signature of the person responsible for approving the Project-Task/Award to be debited is\nrequired for most iJournal types. Online signature for the Project-Task/Award to be credited is\nrequired for Allocation iJournals. In all cases, the department initiating the transfer should make\nsure all individuals responsible for affected PTAs are informed of the entry.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/expenditure-\nmanagement/cost-transfers",

    "text": "3.2.3 Allocations and Offsets\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer.\nLast Updated\nJuly 26, 2022\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 38.1\nThis Guide Memo sets out policies and procedures for expense allocations and salary\ndistribution offsets, which are a form of cost transfer.\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to all Stanford employees responsible for accounting transactions.\n1. Expense Allocation Policies\nAn expense allocation is a method that enables apportionment of a particular expense or\nexpenses to Projects-Tasks-Awards (PTAs) that specifically benefit from those charges.\nAllocations are used in situations where it is difficult to determine in advance how much to\ncharge each PTA for a shared supply or service. They are used to distribute expenses to PTAs\nreceiving the benefit of the good or service. Allocations are often used to distribute costs from\nexpenditure allocation PTAs (formerly knows as \"clearing accounts\") or service centers. They\nmay also be used to distribute costs between benefiting PTAs when a purchase was originally\ncharged to one PTA and one or more other PTAs also benefited from the purchase. Allocations\nare also used to distribute charges from independent systems (known as \"feeders\") into the\nfinancial system. Often allocations are repetitive or are required on a regular basis.\na. Expenditure Allocation PTA Definition\nAn expenditure allocation PTA, as described in Guide Memo 3.1.3\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-\nmanagement/expenditure-accounts-ptas): Expenditure Accounts (PTAs) is a special PTA in\nwhich charges for materials, supplies, services, or salaries are accumulated, and then allocated\neach month to PTAs receiving the benefit of the good or service. Salary and material costs\ncannot be combined in the same expenditure allocation PTA. If salary and material expenses\nmust be combined, a service center must be used. Sponsored project PTAs may not be used as\nexpenditure allocation PTAs.\nb. Allocation Basis\nThe basis of allocation/distribution (e.g., effort, square footage, headcount) must logically relate\nto the type of costs being allocated. It must produce an allocation to each activity/account in\nreasonable proportion to the benefits received. The allocation methodology must produce a\nresult that is allowable, allocable, reasonable and consistent. Feeder systems typically charge\nother departments based on usage or services provided at specified rates. Administrative\nexpenses may not be distributed or rotated among sponsored agreements. Departments shall\nnot use any type of pooled allocation method to charge expenses to federal sponsored\nagreements except from a service center with approved rates, or as described in the Research\nPolicy Handbook. For more information, see Research Administration Policy and Compliance\n(https://ora.stanford.edu/ora-units/research-administration-policy-and-compliance).\nc. Documentation\nOnline expense allocation documentation must clearly show the nature of the cost being\nallocated. The originator of the journal must include comments about the distribution basis in the\nonline documentation and retain documentation of the allocation methodology and calculation\nresults in accordance with the government and University's record retention requirements.\nFeeder systems track the charges and maintain documentation in their own systems.\nd. Approvals\nBefore an allocation journal or feeder is submitted to the financial system, the department\nprocessing the journal/feeder must have received approval from an authorized individual for each\nPTA charged. Certain feeder transactions, such as utility charges, are approved implicitly as part\nof the annual budget process. Approval for other allocations and feeders can be a \"blanket\"\napproval for regular ongoing costs allocated in a consistent manner. Approval can be evidenced\nin writing in a memo, on a request form (e.g., SU-13 or similar form) or via electronic means. The\ndepartment originating the journal/feeder must maintain documentation of written approval. For\nallocation journals, written approval must be on file from individuals with signature authority over\nthe PTAs being charged, while online approval is required for the PTA or Project-Fund-Object\nbeing credited. The originator of the journal attests to the following when creating the allocation\njournal:\nThis allocation is being processed in accordance with policy\nThe cost is an appropriate charge to the PTAs sharing the expense\nThe PTA actually benefited from the cost of the goods and services\nThe transaction is documented according to policy\nFeeder transactions are not routed for online approval, nor does the originator make the above\nattestation in the financial system. The ability to act as a feeder into the financial system is\ngranted by the Controller's Office with the understanding that the transactions follow University\npolicy. Feeder business process owners must sign an annual attestation that they understand\nand accept their responsibilities and have followed the policies. For information on university\npolicy for iJournal expense transfers, refer to Administrative Guide Policy 3.2.2: Cost Transfers\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/expenditure-\nmanagement/cost-transfers).\ne. Deadlines\nAllocation journals should be prepared and submitted before the end of the month following the\nmonth the expense was posted.Example: A cost that appears on an expenditure allocation PTA's\nMarch expenditure or operating statement should be allocated to the PTAs that benefited from\nthe service by the last working day in April. Allocations submitted after the deadlines must include\na valid reason for the delay.\n2. Salary Distribution Offset Policies\nThe federal government and some nongovernment sponsors require that the University charge\nsalaries and wages to sponsored projects as they are earned. However, many faculty members\nwho are on 9-, 10-, or 11-month appointments choose to have a reduced salary amount paid\nover all 12 months of the year. To correctly charge sponsored project PTAs or the related cost\nsharing PTAs in such situations, departments may use the Labor Distribution Schedule method\nor the Salary Distribution Offset method. The Labor Distribution Schedule method is preferred, as\nit requires fewer accounting transactions to accomplish the result. In the employee's Oracle\nLabor Distribution Schedule sponsored or cost sharing PTAs are charged the appropriate\npercentage of the faculty member's 9-month salary (subject to any regulatory caps) for the\nacademic period. The remainder of the amount to be PAID over 12 months is charged to an\noperating budget or other unrestricted PTA. For templates to aid in the calculation, see Faculty\nLabor Distribution Entry Templates\n(http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/payadmin/res_jobaid/faculty_laborDist.html).\n When following the Salary Distribution Offset (using after-the-fact Labor Distribution Adjustments\nfor salary expenses originally incurred after March 31, 2005, or Salary Journals for salary\nexpenses originally incurred before April 1, 2005) method the department must:\nCharge the faculty member's entire salary to the operating budget PTA paying for the non-\nresearch portion of salary. (For more information on payroll processing see Guide Memo\n2.2.3 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-\npolicies/university-payroll): University Payroll, and Faculty Specific Payroll Administration\n(http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/payadmin/payadmin_faculty.html). \nRecord a transfer to allocate the amount of earned salary to the sponsored project(s).The\nsalary actually paid will show as a charge on the expenditure detail report for the operating\nbudget PTA. The salary earned will show as a charge on the sponsored project expenditure\ndetail report and as a credit on the operating budget expenditure detail repo",

Deadlines\nSalary Distribution Offset transfers should be prepared and submitted in the month the salary is\nearned.Example: Salary earned during April should be recorded during April.A Salary Distribution\nOffset transfer submitted after the deadline must include a valid reason for the delay.\n3. Allocation and Offset Procedures\na. Getting Started\nAllocations and offsets, including feeders, are submitted using iJournals or Labor Distribution\nAdjustments in the University's online financial system.

Nonsalary Charges\nAllocations from expenditure allocation PTAs, service centers or other PTAs may be made by the\nfollowing methods:\nAllocation Journals are used for submitting a new allocation, a transaction containing\nrepetitive transfers where charges have been previously authorized. Journal transactions\nentered using this form are limited to non-salary/student-aid expenditure types.\nAllocation Templates may be set up to save time in processing repetitive allocations each\nmonth.\nUpload Allocation and Feeder Journals may be used to upload an allocation created in\nanother system.\nc. Salary Charges\nAllocations from expenditure allocation PTAs or offsets are made by using a Labor Distribution\nAdjustment or a Salary Journal.

    "text": "3.3.1 Infrastructure Charges\nAuthority\nApproved by the Provost and the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer\n(CFO).\nLast Updated\nJune 15, 2009\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 37.3\nThe Board of Trustees of Stanford University approved a revised infrastructure policy in October\n2004. The revised policy, effective September 1, 2005, increases the infrastructure charge (ISC)\nfrom 6% to 8% for both new and existing funds. For designated funds, the infrastructure charge\nwill be applied at the time funds are received from all external revenue sources. For restricted\nfunds (expendable gift funds, endowment income funds and sponsored project funds that carry\nan F&A rate of 0%), the infrastructure charge will be applied at the time funds are expended or\ntransferred.\nGifts for building projects are exempt from the infrastructure charge. The infrastructure charge\ncollected from funds owned by non formula schools will be credited75% to a central University\nPFOO (project/fund/object code/org code) (controlled by the budget office) and 25% to a central\nPFOO owned by the budget unit involved in the transaction. The infrastructure charge collected\nfrom funds owned by formula schools and auxiliaries will be credited directly to a central PFOO\nbelonging to the formula school or auxiliary.\nAny exceptions to the policy require approval of both the Provost and the CFO and are to occur\nrarely, if at all.\nApplicability: This policy applies to restricted funds and designated funds effective September\n1, 2005.\n1. Purpose\nIf Stanford is to maintain long-term financial stability, restricted and designated funds must\ncontribute to the cost of the University's infrastructure. Activities supported by designated and\nrestricted funds represent a significant percentage of the University's total activity. General funds,\nalone, cannot bear the full burden of the infrastructure and administrative costs required to\nsupport these activities. The purpose of this policy is to recover a portion of these costs.\n2. Assessment on Designated Revenue\nThe infrastructure charge is applied to all external designated revenue at the time it is received.\nOnce the designated revenue is deposited in a fund, no infrastructure charge will be applied to\neither expenditures against the fund or transfers out of the fund.\n3. Assessment on Restricted Expendable Funds (Gifts)\nThe infrastructure charge is applied at the time the funds are expended or transferred. All\nexpenditure types are subject to the charge.\n4. Assessment on Restricted Endowment Income\nThe infrastructure charge is applied at the time the funds are expended or transferred.\nEndowment funds whose purpose is restricted by the donor to academic-year tenure line salaries\n(professorships), undergraduate and graduate student financial aid, or undergraduate research\nopportunities are not subject to the infrastructure charge. Restricted endowments that are not\nspecifically restricted to these purposes but are used to support these activities will incur the\ncharge.\n5. Assessment on Sponsored Projects\nSponsored project awards that carry an F&A rate (indirect cost rate) of 0% are subject to the\ninfrastructure charge as follows:\na. Sponsored project awards with start dates prior to September 1, 2005, are subject to the\nprevious infrastructure policy and rate of 6%. Sponsored project awards with start dates on\nor after September 1, 2005, are subject to the revised policy unless they meet the\nexception in 5.d (2) below.\nb. Sponsored project awards made in response to proposals submitted using the previous\ninfrastructure policy and rate of 6% will be subject to the previous policy and rate until the\nend of their competitive segment. A new competitive segment will be subject to the revised\ninfrastructure policy.\nc. Proposals submitted on or after September 1, 2005, are subject to the revised\ninfrastructure policy.\nd. The revised infrastructure policy applies to sponsored projects as follows:\n1. No sponsored project award is assessed the infrastructure charge if the award is\nalready paying indirect costs (IDC). Awards paying less than 8% indirect costs are not\ncharged ISC but instead are charged their applicable IDC rates.\n2. The infrastructure charge is assessed on non-government sponsored project awards\nand awards sponsored by foreign governments. U.S. Government awards (federal,\nstate and local government agencies) are excluded from infrastructure.\n3. The infrastructure charge is automatically exempted, but not waived (an alternate\nPTA must be provided by the principal investigator/ department to pay the\ninfrastructure charge) on all non-government and foreign government awards where\nthe sponsor has a written policy stating it does not pay indirects and the\nsponsor/program is on OSR's (Office of Sponsored Research) pre-approved IDC\nwaiver list. A request to exempt the award from the infrastructure charge is not\nrequired.\ne. For all other sponsors who will not pay indirect costs, a request to exempt the award from\nthe infrastructure charge must be submitted and approved by the Provost and the CFO\nbefore an institutional official approves the proposal for submission to the funding agency.\nf. All cost-sharing is exempt.\ng. Institutional allowances for federally-sponsored projects are exempt.\n6. Exceptions to the Policy\nAny exceptions to the policy require approval of both the Provost and the CFO and are to occur\nrarely, if at all. If a donor/sponsor will not allow the infrastructure charge to be applied to a\nrestricted fund, then either the gift/award will have to be refused or the Provost and the CFO may\ngrant an exemption. If an exemption is granted, then the unit receiving the funds must identify an\nalternative source of funding to pay the infrastructure charge. To request an exemption, complete\nthe \"Request for Infrastructure Exemption (https://doresearch.stanford.edu/documents/co-fa-\nrequest-infrastructure-exemption-08082006/download)\" form, following the guidelines posted\nwith the form. \n7.

    "text": "3.3.2 Expendable Funds Investment, Return\nAllocation and Buffer Policy\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer. Approved by the\nStanford University Board of Trustees on December 5, 2017.\nLast Updated\nDecember 10, 2024\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 37.4\nThis policy replaces the “Expendable Funds Investment, Interest Allocation and Buffer Policy”\nadopted by the Board of Trustees on June 9, 2016. The policy was most recently updated by the\nBoard of Trustees on June 13, 2023 and December 4, 2023.\n1. Expendable Funds Investment and Return Allocation\nPolicy\nThe university has two pools for managing expendable funds, the Endowment Income Funds\nPool (“EIFP”) and the Expendable Funds Pool (“EFP”).\na. Endowment Income Funds Pool\nThe EIFP comprises funds holding unspent prior year payout distributed from pure endowment\nfunds (including amounts reinvested in those funds).\n1. Investment Policy: One hundred percent of the assets in the EIFP are to be invested in\ncash and liquid short-term investment vehicles managed in the Short-term Investment Pool\n(“STIP”). \n2. Return Allocation Policy: Each endowment income fund holding unspent prior years’\npayout will receive an allocation equal to the net return on the STIP, less the cost to\nadminister the portfolio.\nb. Expendable Funds Pool\nThe EFP holds the following types of expendable funds:\nEndowment Income Funds – current year payout distributed from pure endowment funds\nand all payout from Funds Functioning as Endowment (“FFE”) not yet expended\nRestricted Funds – gifts or other restricted expendable funds not yet expended\nDesignated Funds – funds designated for a specific school, department, faculty or purpose,\nnot yet expended\nUnrestricted Funds – university, school, department, auxiliary or faculty funds held in\nreserve or pending expenditure\nGifts Pending Designation – gift funds received for which the purpose has not yet been\ndesignated and which are not invested in the Merged Pool or Intermediate Pool\nPlant Funds – funds designated for facilities, not yet expended.\nRecycling Pool – proceeds from internal debt amortization available to lend to projects\nInsurance and Benefit Program Reserves – reserves held for claims within self-insurance\nprograms\nStudent Loan Funds – funds available to lend for student loans\nAgency Funds – funds held by Stanford University on behalf of third parties\nInvestment Policy\nDepending on the University’s operating and other liquidity requirements, the University’s Chief\nFinancial Officer or their designee will determine appropriate balances to be invested in the\nIntermediate Pool (IP) or cash and liquid investment vehicles managed in the STIP.  The\nremainder of the EFP is to be cross-invested in the MP. The University may also draw on a bank\nline or other debt vehicle to fund liquidity needs as deemed necessary by the University’s Chief\nFinancial Officer or their designee. \nReturn Allocation Policy\nFunds invested in the EFP are grouped into two categories for purposes of allocating investment\nreturns.\na. Money-Market Accounts\nThe following types of Expendable Funds will be treated as “Money-Market Accounts” and will\nreceive an allocation equal to the net return on the STIP:\nRestricted Funds, only when stipulated by donor requirement\nGifts Pending Designation, excluding class gift funds and donor funds of less than\n$100,000\nPlant Funds, raised from gifts exceeding $1 million\nInsurance and Benefit Program Reserves\nStudent Loan Funds\nAgency Funds\nb. Zero-Interest Accounts\nAll other Expendable Funds will be treated as “Zero-Interest Accounts.” Investment returns on\nthese funds will not be allocated to the individual fund, but will be accumulated and distributed to\nthe funds, as described below: \nSchool of Medicine (SoM) Dean’s Unrestricted Fund will receive an allocation related to\nzero-interest account balances controlled by the SoM dean’s office, departments, and\nfaculty.\nGraduate School of Business (GSB) Dean’s Unrestricted Fund will receive an allocation\nrelated to zero-interest account balances controlled by the GSB dean’s office, departments,\nand faculty.\nHoover Institution’s Finance and Director’s Office Unrestricted Fund will receive an\nallocation related to zero-interest account balances controlled by Hoover’s Finance and\nDirector’s Office, departments, and faculty.\nProvost’s General Fund will receive an allocation related to all other zero-interest account\nbalances.\nEffective Sept. 1, 2024, the allocation shall be 5.5% of the zero-interest account average monthly\nbalances during the prior fiscal year.\n2. Buffer Policy\nThe total allocation to Money-Market Accounts, General Fund and Dean's Unrestricted Funds will\ndiffer from the investment returns of the EFP. These differences will be buffered by the \"Tier I\nBuffer\" and the \"Tier II Buffer.\"\nThe Tier I Buffer is the University's unrestricted FFE funds, excluding Land Development\nFunds. These funds are fully invested in the MP and receive a regular MP-based payout\nused to support the Provost's General Fund.\nThe Tier II Buffer is a single unrestricted FFE fund. This fund is primarily invested in the MP.\nA fraction of the Tier II Buffer is invested in separately managed investments such as the\nPresident’s Venture Fund. The portion of the Tier II Buffer invested in the MP receives a\nregular MP-based payout that is distributed at the President’s discretion (“President’s\nFunds”). In addition, the President is authorized to withdraw up to $30 million in principal\neach year to be used at their discretion.\nTo the extent there is a shortfall in EFP investment returns relative to stipulated allocations,\nprincipal will be withdrawn from the Tier I and Tier II Buffers to make up such shortfall, as follows:\nFirst, from the Tier I Buffer up to a limit of 20% of the fiscal year-end market value of the\nTier I Buffer in any fiscal year\nSecond, from the Tier II Buffer until fully depleted\nThird, from the remainder of the Tier I Buffer\nTo the extent there is a surplus of EFP investment returns relative to stipulated allocations,\nexcess returns will be added to the Tier I and Tier II Buffers as follows:\nFirst, to the Tier I Buffer until such time as the value of the Tier I Buffer, in total, equals 35%\nof the total value of the EFP (\"the target threshold\")\nSecond, to the Tier II Buffer\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/infrastructure-\ncharges-and-expendable-funds/expendable-funds",

Some\ncommon types of financial irregularities are corruption (e.g., bribery, kickbacks, bid riggings, etc.),\nconflicts of interest (e.g., sale and purchase schemes, etc.) and asset misappropriation involving\ncash, inventory or other University assets. Examples of asset misappropriation can include the\nfollowing:\ntheft of cash\nthe use of a University issued credit card or the expense reimbursement system to make\npersonal purchases\nthe directing of University resources such as supplies, inventory or labor to outside\norganizations\nthe directing of University revenues (e.g., event ticket proceeds, research funding, etc.) to\noutside organizations\nDepartments must immediately notify the Office of the Chief Risk Officer or the Ethics and\nCompliance Helpline of suspected financial irregularities.

    "text": "3.7.1 Establishment and Governance of\nLegal Entities\nAuthority\nVice President and General Counsel, and the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief\nFinancial Officer\nLast Updated\nSeptember 28, 2017\nEffective Date\nSeptember 28, 2017\nApplicability: To facilitate compliance with the responsibilities discussed above, this policy sets\nforth requirements for the creation, acquisition, disposition, and termination of legal entities\naffiliated with Stanford. \nIn addition to the requirements set forth below, the Office of the General Counsel and Financial\nManagement Services may assist with the ongoing maintenance of legal entities affiliated with\nStanford.\n1. Establishment and Governance of Legal Entities\nStanford University will, on occasion, create or acquire a legal entity in furtherance of the\nuniversity’s mission. These legal entities can serve many purposes, including the conduct of\noperations critical to the university (such as support of business registrations in countries outside\nof the United States). They also carry certain responsibilities, including organizational\ngovernance, financial controls, risk management, and government filings.\nThis memo addresses the limited circumstances when a legal entity may be created, acquired,\ndisposed of, or terminated by Stanford. This policy does not apply to investment entities or those\nentities received via donor gift, which are subject to other relevant policies and guidelines of the\nStanford Management Company and the Office of Development, as applicable.\nAs used in this policy, the term “legal entity” includes an organization recognized as separate\nfrom its owners by the relevant taxing authority or is otherwise recognized as having legal\nstanding under the applicable laws. Examples of a legal entity include a corporation (for-profit or\nnot-for-profit), limited liability company, partnership, unincorporated association, or trust. A legal\nentity may be formed within or outside the United States.\n2. Legal Entities Affiliated with Stanford\nA legal entity affiliated with Stanford may be created, acquired, disposed of, or terminated only\nwith the approval of both the Office of the General Counsel and Financial Management Services,\nper the procedure below. The university's individual schools and other operating units cannot\ntake independent action with respect to legal entities. Stanford employees contemplating the\ncreation, acquisition, disposition or termination of an affiliated legal entity should contact the\nOffice of the General Counsel, which will provide advice on the approach best suited to support\nthe programmatic objective. Registration and maintenance of a legal entity over its lifetime can\nbe both time consuming and costly. Other alternatives may be more expedient and compatible\nwith the goals of shorter term academic activities, such as a contractual arrangement with a local\ninstitution or seeking an exemption from registration, if possible.  \nIn the event the General Counsel and the Senior Associate Vice President for Finance determine\nthat it is necessary to take one of the above actions with respect to a legal entity, the General\nCounsel’s Office will provide guidance on the process. The department or school sponsoring the\nlegal entity will be responsible for covering any costs arising from outside counsel and other\nagents that must be retained by the university to accomplish the requested action. In the event\nan entity is created or acquired, additional procedures will need to be established and followed\nby the sponsor to ensure the ongoing governance and maintenance of the entity.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/legal-\nentities/establishment-and-governance-legal-entities",

These sections cover accounting for University fund\nbalances and reconciling and attesting to expenditure statements for sponsored projects,\nrespectively.\n1. Reconciliation Purpose\nAccount balance reconciliations provide reasonable assurance that account balances on the\nUniversity’s Statement of Financial Position are accurate, complete and valid. Together the\naccount balance reconciliations and account balance attestations are key internal controls that\nprovide reasonable assurance around the following financial statement assertions:\nAccuracy: Transactions were accurately recorded at appropriate amounts.\nCompleteness: All assets, liabilities and net asset balances that should have been recorded\nwere correctly recorded on the Statement of Financial Position.\nExistence: All assets, liabilities and net asset balances that were recorded on the\nStatement of Financial Position existed at the end of the financial period.\n2. Definitions\nA. Statement of Financial Position\nThe Statement of Financial Position is a financial statement that reports the balances of the\nUniversity’s assets, liabilities and net assets at a point in time. The Statement of Financial\nPosition is also known as a Balance Sheet. Additional information about the Statement for\nFinancial Position is available in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the\nGateway to Financial Activities (https://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/balrecon/) website.\nB. Account Balance\nAn account balance on the Statement of Financial Position represents the balance of an asset or\nliability at a point in time, such as at the end of a month, quarter or year. \nThe University’s assets on the Statement of Financial Position represent resources owned\nor used by the University and include cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses,\ninventory, pledges receivable, loans receivable, investments, and plant facilities. Assets are\ndesignated with a 1XXXX series object code (https://fingate.stanford.edu/account-\nstructure/purpose-and-use-object-codes) or expenditure type\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/account-structure/purpose-and-use-expenditure-type-codes) in\nthe University’s Chart of Accounts\n(https://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/acctstructure/res_jobaid.html). Assets\ntypically have a debit (positive) balance.\nThe University’s liabilities on the Statement of Financial Position (#statement) represent\ndebt or obligations to others and include accounts payable, accrued expenses, liabilities\nassociated with investments, notes and bonds payable, and U.S. government refundable\nloan funds. Liabilities are designated with a 2XXXX series object code\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/account-structure/purpose-and-use-object-codes) or\nexpenditure type (https://fingate.stanford.edu/account-structure/purpose-and-use-\nexpenditure-type-codes) in the University’s Chart of Accounts\n(https://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/acctstructure/res_jobaid.html). Liabilities\ntypically have a credit (negative) balance.\nC. Account Balance Reconciliation\nAn account balance reconciliation is the comparison of one or more asset or liability account\nbalances in the general ledger to another, often independent or more detailed source of financial\ndata, such as a bank statement, a subledger or another system. The differences between the\naccount balance and the other source of financial data are reconciling items. Reconciling items\nmay be caused by timing differences or errors, such as general ledger errors, bank errors, or\nsubledger system errors that should be resolved in a timely manner.\n3. Responsibility for Reconciliations\nA. Reconciliation Preparation and Review\nAt least quarterly, each University department with an asset or liability account balance in the\ngeneral ledger is responsible for designating individuals who are responsible for reconciling and\nreviewing those balances on all ledgers (typically within 30 days of general ledger close).\nMultiple account balances that are of a similar nature may be reconciled together in one\nreconciliation, as needed. For some object codes there may be multiple account balances that\nare the responsibility of different departments. Each department is individually responsible for\nreconciling its respective balance.\nIn addition to quarterly reconciliations, some account balances must be reconciled and reviewed\nmonthly. The University Controller’s Office designates reconciliation frequency for account\nbalances based on multiple factors including risk, materiality and history.\nIndividuals responsible for reconciling and reviewing cash accounts should also refer to Guide\nMemo 3.6.1: Bank Accounts (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-\nadministration/bank-accounts/bank-accounts) and the Office of the Treasurer’s website\n(http://treasurer.stanford.edu/) for additional guidance on bank reconciliations.\nEach University department with an account balance on the Statement of Financial Position is\nresponsible for:\ndeveloping and maintaining desk procedures for account balance reconciliations.\nensuring that account balance reconciliations contain adequate supporting documentation.\nensuring that reconciling items are resolved in a timely manner.  \nAccount balance reconciliation best practices and other resources are available in the Balance\nSheet Account Reconciliations section of the Gateway to Financial Activities\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/balrecon/) website.\nB. Correction of Transactional Errors\nIf transactional errors are discovered during the account reconciliation, the department is\nresponsible for their correction.\nInformation about how to correct miscoded transactions is available in the Balance Sheet\nAccount Reconciliations section of the Gateway to Financial Activities\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/balrecon/) website.\nC. Compliance with Policies and Procedures\nUniversity departments are responsible for implementing and maintaining adequate reconciliation\nprocedures, including reconciliation approval and segregation of duties. Refer to section d.\nReconciliation Roles (#reconciliation) below for additional information about reconciliation\nsegregation of duties.\nUniversity departments are responsible for adhering to department-specific reconciliation policies\nand procedures. It is recommended that University departments annually review all department-\nspecific reconciliation policies and procedures for accuracy and validity.\nUniversity departments are responsible for adhering to all University policies and procedures\nduring the reconciliation process. This includes but is not limited to adherence to University\npolicies and procedures regarding:\nStewardship of University resources (see section 6 Financial Responsibilities and Internal\nControls in Guide Memo 1.1.1.: University Code of Conduct\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/university-code-\nconduct/university-code-conduct))\nRecord retention of approved reconciliations for future review by the University’s external\nauditors, internal auditors or the University Controller’s Office (see Guid",

Reconciliation Roles\nUniversity departments are responsible for establishing appropriate segregation of duties for\naccount balance reconciliations. Segregation of duties is an internal control that helps safeguard\nUniversity resources by separating responsibility for a task. The same individual should not\nprepare and also review a reconciliation. Additionally, University departments are responsible for\nsegregating the reconciliation preparation and activity recording duties. The same individual\nshould not record transactional activity and also reconcile the account balance.\nReconciliation preparation and approval should only be performed by individuals with knowledge\nof the account balance and an understanding of the reconciliation purpose. Reconciliation\nreviewers are responsible for ensuring that reconciliation preparers are adequately trained and\npossess the skill, experience and competence for preparing the reconciliation.\nReconciliation responsibilities are designated by role in the Reconciliation Roles and\nResponsibilities Matrix in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the Gateway to\nFinancial Activities (https://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/balrecon/) website.\n4. Reconciliation Review\nThe University Controller’s Office periodically conducts independent reviews of account balance\nreconciliations. It is expected that reconciliations will be completed prior to the date of request\n(typically within 30 days of general ledger close) and provided to the Controller’s Office upon\nrequest as needed during an audit or other financial statement review.  Information about the\nReconciliation Review Program is available in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section\nof the Gateway to Financial Activities (https://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/balrecon/) website.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/account-balance-\nreconciliation-and-attestation/account-balance",

    "text": "5.2.1 Financing of Purchases\nAuthority\nApproved by the Senior Associate Vice President for Finance.\nLast Updated\nNovember 30, 2018\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 53\nThis Guide Memo describes arrangements by which the University advances loans that are\nrepaid over time to schools and departments to finance capital projects, programs or purchase\nequipment.\n1. Definitions\na. \"University financing\"\nis an internal mechanism whereby the University makes an unsecured loan (\"Internal Loan\") to a\nschool or department to finance capital projects, programs or purchase equipment and recovers\nthe loan principal, plus interest, over the useful life of the asset by system generated journal\nentries from a PTA (Project/Task/Award) or PTAs identified by the department. The authorization\nto borrow is documented in a Funding Agreement for projects that are approved by the Board of\nTrustees (BOT) and in a Form 1 for other projects. While the asset is owned by the University,\nthe school/department retains all ownership responsibilities, including recording the equipment\npurchase into the Sunflower Assets System as soon as it is received and in service.\nb. \"Amortization\"\nalso referred to as debt service, is the repayment of principal and/or interest over the term of an\nInternal Loan. For service centers, the principal component of debt amortization payments on a\nproject is treated as a proxy for asset depreciation expense charges and is included in the\nservice centers' rates as such. Interest is charged and principal balances are amortized based on\nthe prior period's ending principal balance.\nc. \"Religious Use\"\nmeans any use including services, meetings and any other activity conducted by or for a\nreligious group or organization in a University facility.\nd. \"Private Use\"\ngenerally means the use of tax-exempt-financed property in a trade or business by any person or\nentity other than the borrower, a 501(c)(3) affiliate of the borrower, or a state or local government\nentity, and use by the borrower [or any other 501 (c)(3) organization] in an \"unrelated trade or\nbusiness.\" The use does not have to result in unrelated business income to be considered\nprivate use. Private use examples may include but are not limited to: lease of university property\nto non-university entities; non-compliant management or service contracts (e.g., food service\ncontracts); non-compliant corporate sponsored research agreements; naming rights\narrangements with a private user.\ne. \"Substantial Completion\"\noccurs when an asset is \"placed-in-service.\" An asset is placed in service when one of the\nfollowing conditions is met (in order of availability and importance):\n1. issuance of a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO)\n2. signed-off Permit,or\n3. certification by a Project Manager\n2. Purchases Eligible for Debt Financing\nSchools and departments may obtain Internal Loans for academic capital projects, capital\nequipment purchases, service center capital projects and capital equipment purchases, auxiliary\nprojects and capital equipment purchases, bridge financing the receipt of gift pledges and\nreceivables, and other University programs such as the Faculty Staff Housing Program.\nOnce an Internal Loan is approved, the Treasurer's Office and Capital Accounting determine\nwhether the project is eligible for taxable, tax-exempt, or a mix of taxable and tax_exempt debt. If\nthe Funding Agreement or Form 1 indicates that a capital project is designated for academic\npurposes and tax-exempt debt is allocated to the project, it is implied that there will not be a\nchange in use throughout the life of the project. Penalties may be incurred if religious and/or\nprivate use take place in facilities financed with tax-exempt debt. The Treasurer's Office, the Tax\nDirector or the Capital Accounting Bond/Tax Compliance Analyst in the Controllers' Office should\nbe notified if religious and/or private use in a tax-exempt financed facility is contemplated at any\ntime. Questions regarding Private Use or Religious Use can be directed to the Capital\nAccounting Bond/Tax Compliance Analyst.\n3. Approvals\na. University Approvals\nThe Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or their designee is advised on debt allocations by a group\nconsisting of representatives from the Provost's Office, Land, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE),\nand the Controller's Office. Certain allocations of debt may be subject to completion of a debt\naffordability analysis conducted by the Treasurer's Office and approval by the CFO. Financing of\nall capital projects requires an authorized Form 1 or, approval from the Board of Trustees (BOT)\nand an executed Funding Agreement. Form 1 approval procedures\n(http://lbre.stanford.edu/cap_plan/) are outlined on the LBRE/Department of Capital Planning\nwebsite. Guide Memo 8.3.1 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/services/capital-\nprojects/capital-projects): Capital Projects, provides guidance on capital projects.\nThe BOT must review and approve increases in budgeted project costs for BOT level projects,\nincluding new building construction, projects with a total cost of $10 million and above, use of\n5,000 or more new square feet within the academic growth boundary, changes in land use, and\nprojects with major exterior design changes.\nBridge financing of gift pledges for capital projects requires prior approval from the Provost and\nthe CFO and must be documented in a Funding Agreement. The Funding Agreement addresses\nfinancial responsibility during and after construction. See Section 4.f for information on the\nrepayment of Internal Loans, which bridge finance the receipt of gifts.\nThe Capital Accounting department in the Controller's Office is responsible for processing\napproval for all capital projects and capital equipment loans.\nb. Capital Equipment Approvals\nSchools may require approval from the School Dean's Office before committing to finance a\ncapital equipment purchase.\n4. Internal Loan Terms\nThe BOT approves University debt issuances and delegates responsibility to the CFO to issue\ndebt in the capital markets and to advance Internal Loans to schools and departments. The\norganization responsible for servicing Internal Loans (Paying Organization) and funding sources\nmust be identified at the time of approval and documented in a Form 1 or in a Funding\nAgreement. The Paying Organization will be responsible for monthly amortization payments\n(interest and principal) on an Internal Loan over the remaining useful life of the asset being\nfinanced. The Treasurer's Office is responsible for the repayment of external debt.\na. Budgeted Interest Rate (BIR)\nThe University accumulates, by project, in a single fund (Single Interest Fund) all interest\nexpense and bond issuance costs (\"Interest\") from notes and bonds issued to finance capital\nprojects and programs that support the academic mission of the University. The BIR is the\nweighted average rate of all Interest related expenditures, including administrative costs, over\nthe projected outstanding debt of the University available for project/program loans during the\nsame accounting period (generally the University's fiscal year). The BIR is charged to the\noutstanding unamortized Internal Loan principal balance. Notes and bonds or other debt issued\nto finance activities unrelated to the academic not for profit mission of the University, or issued to\nfinance a specific asset are excluded from the BIR calculation.\nb. Taxable Debt Premium\nIf, as a result of management decisions, the project funding structure requires taxable debt when\ntax-exempt debt would have otherwise been permitted, a 1% interest \"Premium\" will be\nassessed. The Premium will be calculated on the Internal Loan principal balance outstanding, it\ncannot be capitalized and will be charged directly to an operating account until the taxable debt\nis fully amortized. The Premium is subject to change throughout the internal amortization period.\nThe 1% Premium will be published along with the BIR.\nc. Prepayment Penalty\nThe bo",

Prepayment Penalty\nThe borrower may incur a prepayment penalty (\"Penalty\") if debt requested for the project is\nreduced after the Form 1 or Funding Agreement has been executed. The Premium will be\nequivalent to (1) interest expense on the corresponding bond obligation until such time as\nproceeds have been redeployed, or (2) premiums and fees incurred to repurchase the\ncorresponding bond obligation in the open market.\nd. Exceptions to the BIR\nThe BIR is not charged to projects for which construction is in progress (CIP). During CIP and\nuntil Substantial Completion, interest on Internal Loans is added to the loan principal balance\noutstanding and capitalized. During CIP, the interest rate charge is the effective monthly\nweighted average interest rate computed by Capital Accounting. The intent is to make the\ncapitalized interest expense included in the cost of construction, an accurate component of the\ntotal cost of the building, which is then used to calculate depreciation expense for financial\nreporting.\ne. BIR Calculation\nEach year in December, or as needed for the general funds forecast, the Treasurer's Office in\ncollaboration with the Capital Accounting group develop a BIR forecast for next fiscal year's\nbudget.\nDuring the course of the fiscal year, the Capital Accounting group compares the effective BIR\nwith the approved BIR. The CFO determines if the variance between effective and approved BIR\nrequires an interim adjustment. In the event of a mid-year reset, the prior months' interest\nexpense will not be restated.\nf. Amortization of Internal Loans\nIn the month following Substantial Completion of a capital project, installation of capital\nequipment, or the drawdown of an Internal Loan for a program, the Capital Accounting group\nassesses the BIR on Internal Loan principal balances outstanding and collects principal\namortization. Monthly payments are adjusted to reflect changes in the BIR, and amortization\nproceeds are deposited in the Recycling Pool and used for future internal lending.\nDebt service on projects financed with tax-exempt debt must be funded with current\noperating revenue. The Paying Organization must provide an operating account PTA to be\nincluded in the Form 1 or Funding Agreement.\nLoans for academic facilities projects and auxiliary programs amortize on monthly level\npayments (principal payments increase and interest decreases) over the remaining life of\nthe asset or program.\nService Center fixed assets and capital equipment purchases amortize on a fixed principal\npayment schedule (straight-line amortization) over the remaining useful life of the asset, in\norder to mimic the asset's financial depreciation expense, which is included in service\ncenter rates.\nInternal Loans used to bridge finance the gap between construction costs and the receipt of\nfunds, e.g., gifts and pledges, is intended to be short-term financing. Typically, pledges are\npaid off within three years of the project completion in accordance with a binding\nschedule. Bridge Financing Loan Terms:\nIf, at any time after Substantial Completion of a project, gifts have not been identified,\ndo not have signed pledge agreements, or will not be received, the CFO will\ndetermine whether the school or department financially responsible for the Internal\nLoan must:\n1. Immediately repay the funds\n2. Extend or allow continuation of the bridge loan term.\nBridge Financing loans will begin amortizing in the first full month after substantial\ncompletion based on an amortization period equivalent to the asset life, with monthly\nlevel payments. Additionally, Bridge Financing loans will be fully paid off the earlier of\nthe 60th month after substantial completion or receipt of gift/pledge payments, unless\nthe borrowing school/department receives an approved loan extension from the CFO,\nin the form of a signed amended Funding Agreement.\nAny school/department funds used to pay down the loan during the amortization\nperiod may be recovered by the school/department when the pledge(s) are received,\nonce all bridge financing has been paid down, unless otherwise indicated in the\nFunding Agreement.\n5. Amortization Schedule\na. Payment\nDebt service payments start one month following Substantial Completion. For example, if a\nproject is completed during May, the debt service payment will start in June. The project will be\ncharged capitalized interest in May based on April's ending balance. In June, the project will\nbegin amortizing based on May's ending balance. For purchased equipment (not included in a\ncapital project), the debt service payment starts in the month following the payment for that\nequipment.\nb. Interest\nThe BIR is used to calculate the interest portion of the debt service payments. The BIR may\nchange during a fiscal year. Prior months' interest expense will not be restated. The University\nreserves the right to make retroactive adjustments to the BIR if required.\nc. Schedules\nThere are two amortization schedules: level payment and fixed principal.\nLevel payment\nInternal Loans for academic and auxiliary capital projects are amortized on a monthly level\npayment schedule over the useful life of the asset being financed. Payments are adjusted\nto reflect changes in the BIR. The principal component increases over time as the interest\ncomponent decreases.\nFixed principal\nService Center capital projects and all capital equipment purchases are amortized on a\nfixed principal payment schedule over the life of the asset. Payments are adjusted to reflect\nchanges in the BIR. The interest component fluctuates with the BIR, but the principal\ncomponent remains the same and is charged straight line, over the useful life of the asset.\n6. Asset Categories and Lives\nAmortization of Internal Loans is based on the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset\ncategory or the actual useful life of the asset (e.g., asset disposal or sale). The following are\namortization lives (amortization periods) listed by asset category:\nAsset Categories and Lives\n \nAsset Category Life\nComputer Equipment 3 years\nVehicles 4 years\nData Handling Equipment 5 years\nScientific/Technical Equipment 5 years\nStandard Telecommunications Equipment 5 years\nIT (Information Technology) Systems 7 years\nGeneral Purpose Equipment 10 years\nComplex Telecommunications Equipment 10 years\nFurniture 10 years\nModular Furniture 10 years\nShop Machinery and Tools 10 years\nDedicated Special Purpose Building Space 15 years\nElectrical and Utility Control System 15 years\nStorm Drains 15 years\nBuilding Renovations, including component Replacements20 years\nSteam and Chilled Water Utility Distribution Systems22 years\nDomestic Water and Sanitary Sewer Pipelines 30 years\nNew Building Constructions 30 years\nParking Structures and Lots 30 years\nSteam and Chilled Water Utility Production Equipment30 years\nElectric and Signal Ducts 40 years\nMajor Structures (dams and reservoirs) 40 years\n \nCapital Improvements to a Leased space; lesser of the initial lease term or the asset's estimated\nuseful life.\nThese amortization periods reflect specific assets' expected useful life and are generally\nconsistent with the University's depreciable lives used for financial statements reporting. For\nindirect cost recovery and financial statement reporting, academic buildings and land\nimprovements are depreciated by components, but for the amortization of Internal Loans,\ncomposite lives are used.\nFor assets not shown, or if asset life does not fall within the guidelines, please contact Capital\nAccounting.\n7.

    "text": "5.2.2 Equipment Leases\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer.\nLast Updated\nSeptember 1, 2016\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 54.3\nThis Guide Memo describes policies that apply to equipment leases. Capital and operating lease\nliabilities utilize the University's debt capacity. All uses of debt must comply with the University's\ndebt policy and require prior approval. The only parties authorized to execute documents that\ncommit Stanford to an equipment lease obligation are the Director of Procurement, the CFO, or\ntheir designees. For relevant policies, see section 1 in Administrative Guide Memo 5.1.1\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/purchasing-\npolicies/procurement-policies): Procurement Policies. Approvals, requisition processes and\nreporting requirements are included.\n1. Definitions and Terms\na. Leases\nLeases are contracts under which a lessee has committed to pay stipulated cash payments for\nthe use of an asset for a specific period of time. For the purposes of this memo, an equipment\nlease is considered the commitment to pay for the use of an asset for longer than one year, with\ntotal contracted cash payments over the term of the lease of $5,000 or greater.\nCapital and operating leases are considered long-term financial obligations of the University.\nTherefore, all new equipment leases and lease renewals are considered a use of the University's\ndebt capacity.\nb. Rentals\nCommitments not meeting these qualifications should be considered rentals that are not subject\nto this policy.\nc. Capital Lease\nAn equipment lease is capitalized if the total anticipated contracted cash payments over the term\nof the lease, excluding any transportation costs, are greater than or equal to $200,000, on a per\ncontract basis, and at least one of the following criteria is met:\nBy the end of the lease term, ownership of the leased property is transferred to Stanford\nThe lease contains a bargain purchase option that Stanford reasonably expects to exercise\nThe lease term is substantially (75% of more) equal to the estimated useful life of the\nleased property\nAt the inception of the lease, the value of the minimum lease payments is 90% or more of\nthe fair value of the leased property.\nCapital leases are reported as an asset and a liability on Stanford's financial statements and\ninterest and depreciation are expensed.           \nd. Operating Lease\nWhen an operating lease does not meet the definition of a capital lease in 1.c above, the\noperating lease payments are expensed as incurred.\n2. Equipment Leases\na. Approvals and Thresholds\nEquipment leases with total anticipated contracted cash payments over the term of the lease of\n$200,000 and above must be approved by the CFO. Equipment leases with total contracted cash\npayments over the term of the lease under $200,000 can be approved by managers with\nrequisite expenditure authority in relationship to total contracted cash payments.\nb. Approval Forms\nThe Equipment Lease Approval form can be downloaded from the Gateway to Financial Activities\n(http://www.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/capitalequip/forms.html) website. \nc. Board of Trustees Approval\nEquipment leases with total anticipated contracted cash payments of $5,000,000 and above\nrequire approval by the Board of Trustees.\nd. Requisition\nFollowing budget approval, departments must submit an online requisition for the total contracted\ncash payments over the term of the lease to Procurement in Oracle Financials using the\nStandard Lease category.\ne. Lease Terms\nProcurement is responsible for negotiating equipment lease terms. Equipment leases must be\nsigned and executed by the Director of Procurement or the CFO.\nf. Reporting Requirements\nDepartmental Property Administrators are responsible for establishing and maintaining property\nrecords for leased equipment in the Sunflower Asset Management System. Leased equipment\nmust be tagged and tracked according to the policies of the Property Management Office\n(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/office/property-management-office). \nBy September 30 each year, departments must provide the Controller's Office with a certificate\nand a schedule of all equipment lease obligations to assist with the preparation of the\nUniversity's financial statements and the property tax-exemption application. Reporting forms for\nequipment lease obligations can be downloaded from the Gateway to Financial Activities\n(http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/capitalequip/forms.html) website.\ng. Return of Equipment\nUnless the department wishes to buy the equipment, a memo to Procurement is sufficient to\nreturn the item at the end of the lease. Procurement will notify the lessor.\nh. Equipment Purchase at the End of the Agreement\nTo buy equipment at the end of a lease, the department must submit a new online requisition,\nusing the Standard Capital Equipment category and referencing the original lease purchase\norder number.\ni. Receiving Equipment\nThe department must inspect, verify and document the condition of leased equipment when\nreceived. Online receiving in Oracle Financials is required for leased equipment. A record for\neach asset must be entered into the Sunflower Asset Management System within 30 days of\nreceipt.\nj. Insurance\nStanford's high deductible insurance coverage makes it unlikely that the University's insurance\ncarrier would pay for any loss or damage. Therefore, lessor's insurance for equipment should\ncover all aspects of damage and injury. For more information, contact the Assistant Vice\nPresident of Risk Management.\nk. Change of Terms\nDepartments must observe the start and stop dates of the lease. Using the equipment outside\nthe terms of the agreement has significant contractual implications and may subject Stanford to\nadditional rental charges, early termination charges, and other liabilities. The lessor's insurance\nmay be valid only during the stated period. To terminate an equipment lease early, the\ndepartment must contact the assigned buyer in Procurement.\nl. Renewals and Extensions\nDepartments must submit an online requisition to Procurement to extend the duration or renew\nthe term of a lease.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/capital-\nassets-and-equipment/equipment-leases",

Only Procurement and the CFO\nare authorized to execute documents that commit Stanford to a loan obligation.\n1. Definition of Terms\na. Loans of Equipment\nA loan occurs when Stanford receives free use of equipment. For example, a manufacturer may\nlend Stanford experimental or prototype equipment that needs testing under regular operating\nconditions. Even though no payment is involved, other liabilities, such as insurance coverage\nand repair costs, need to be covered by a loan agreement negotiated, signed and executed by\nProcurement.\nb. Sponsor-Furnished Property\nSponsor-furnished property is a loan of property from a sponsor and managed under the terms\nand conditions of an existing sponsored award or bailment agreement. The Property\nManagement Office, in conjunction with Office of Sponsored Research, is responsible for\nensuring the terms and conditions of the award are followed. Find more information about\nSponsor-furnished property at Acquisition chapter, Section 2.4 Loans, Transfers and Leases\n(http://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/property-management-manual/acquisition/loans-\ntransfers-leases-and-rentals), in the Property Management Manual.\nc.

Forward any agreement\nforms or other documentation to Procurement.\nb. Equipment Purchase at the End of the Agreement\nTo buy equipment at the end of a loan, the department must submit a new online requisition\nusing the Standard Capital Equipment category and referencing the original purchase order\nnumber.\n3. Receiving & Recording\nThe department must inspect, verify and document the condition of loaned equipment when\nreceived. Online receiving in Oracle Financials is required for loaned equipment as it is for\npurchased equipment.\nDepartmental Property Administrators are responsible for establishing and maintaining property\nrecords for loaned equipment in the Sunflower asset management system. Within 30 days of\nreceipt, loaned equipment must be tagged and tracked according to the polices in the Property\nManagement Manual (http://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/property-management-manual).\n4. Insurance Coverage\nStanford's goal is for the lender's insurance to cover all aspects of damage and injury related to\nan equipment loan. Contact the Assistant Vice President of Risk Management or the Director of\nProcurement if there is any question of Stanford assuming any liability for the loan or that\nappropriate coverage is provided.\nIf the lender is not providing insurance, note this on the requisition.\n5. Change of Terms\nDepartments must observe the start and stop dates of the loan. Using the item outside the terms\nof the agreement has significant contractual implications and may subject Stanford to rental\ncharges, early termination charges, and other liabilities. The lender's insurance may be valid only\nduring the stated period.\n6. Return of Equipment\nUnless the department wishes to buy the equipment, a memo or email to the assigned buyer in\nProcurement is sufficient to return the item at the end of loan. Procurement will notify the lender.\nTo terminate an equipment loan early, the department must contact the assigned buyer in\nProcurement.

    "text": "5.2.4 Surplus Property Sales\nAuthority\nApproved by the Associate Vice President for Research Administration.\nLast Updated\nJuly 12, 2013\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 56\nThis Guide Memo covers sale of surplus University property.\n1. Authority to Transact Sales\na. Surplus Property Sales Office\nThe mission of the Surplus Property Sales office (SPS) is to sell University property for the best\npossible price while ensuring responsible handling of excess assets and contributing to campus-\nwide sustainability initiatives. The Board of Trustees has authorized only SPS to perform this\nfunction (Resolution Number 3 September 13, 1983). Therefore, the only entity authorized to sell\ntangible personal property (hereafter referred to as \"property\") to non-Stanford entities is SPS.\nFor the purpose of this document \"property\" is defined as capital and non-capital movable assets\nincluding, but not limited to, equipment and accessories, furniture, vehicles, or supplies.\nSpecialized sales may include significant involvement by departments, including the identification\nof a potential buyer. In such cases, the sale must be pre-approved and processed by SPS.  The\ncheck from the buyer is to be made payable to Stanford University Surplus Sales, and include\nsales tax, where applicable. All payments must be deposited by Surplus Property Sales.\nb. University Departments\nDepartments may not give, sell or donate property to individuals, including Stanford employees\nand students, or to non-Stanford entities, including non-profits. If a department arranges a buyer\nto purchase property, the sale amount must be approved by SPS.  All sale transactions must go\nthrough SPS. Departments may transfer property to other departments, either for no charge or\nfor credit to departmental accounts. The property must be used for University business purposes.\nThe ReUse website (http://reuse.stanford.edu) is available to facilitate viewing and posting items\navailable for interdepartmental transfer. The transferring and receiving departments must notify\nthe Department Property Administrator (DPA) (https://sparc.stanford.edu/apex/f?\np=125%3A101%3A10679011573796) and Property Programs Manager (PPM)\n(https://ora.stanford.edu/campus-support-team)  of a transfer to ensure asset records reflect the\nchange. Refer to the Property Management Manual (https://ora.stanford.edu/ora-units/property-\nmanagement-office/property-management-manual) for transfer procedures.\n2. Sales Tax\na. Transfer Between University Departments\nBecause title to the item remains in the University, there is no sales tax incurred.\nb. External Sales\nSales tax will be applied, as required, to all external transactions.\n3. Basic Sale Policies\na. Disposition Requests\nThe Department Property Administrator (DPA) initiates an excess request upon notification of\nexcess property.  Surplus Sales will determine optimum disposition method for the assets,\nincluding potential sale. For specific information refer to Section 4.2, Disposition and Transfers in\nthe Property Management Office (PMO) Property Management Manual\n(https://ora.stanford.edu/ora-units/property-management-office/property-management-\nmanual#property-management-manual).\nb. Sales Terms and Conditions\nEstablished terms and conditions apply to all sale transactions. Full description of these is\navailable in Section 4.3, Surplus Property Sales, in the Property Management Manual.\nc. Sales Commission\nAs a self-funded department, SPS retains a percentage of all sales based on the SPS Fee\nStructure, for purposes of offsetting operating expenses. The SPS Fee Structure is reviewed and\napproved annually as part of the University's budget process.  Refer to Section 4.3, Surplus\nProperty Sales, in the Property Management Manual (https://ora.stanford.edu/ora-units/property-\nmanagement-office/property-management-manual#property-management-manual) for additional\ndetails.\nd. Sales Expense\nAny expenses related to the sale of an item will be deducted from the proceeds of the sale or\ncharged to the department if no sale occurs. Sales expenses may include, but are not limited to:\nappraisal, advertising, brokerage, or auction fees; diagnostic, registration, smog and repair costs;\nmoving, handling, transportation, and disposal expenses.\ne. Proceeds\nThe proceeds from sales of any University-owned property belong to the University. Sales\nrevenues are distributed in accordance with the approved SPS fee structure.\nf. Delivery\nBuyers are responsible for timely packaging, removal and transport of the items they buy.\ng. Sale Records\nThe buyer may not take possession until payment has been received by SPS. Records of all sale\ntransactions are retained by SPS per University Policy as stated in Guide Memo 3.1.5\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-management/retention-\nfinancial-records): Retention of Financial Records.\nh. Equipment Inventory Update\nProperty records are updated by PMO as appropriate, to reflect the final disposition transaction.\ni. Non-Marketable Property\nItems that are broken, inoperable or otherwise deemed unsellable will be disposed or recycled\nper University policies via the prescribed excess process by Surplus Sales. For equipment items\nthere is no additional cost to departments for this service. For furniture items, such items may be\ndisposed of by departments at their cost with prior approval from PMO.\nj. Right of Refusal\nSurplus Sales may refuse items that are deemed to be in non-marketable condition. Delivery will\nbe diverted to PSSI for disposal at the originating department's expense.\n4. Sales Requiring Particular Caution\na. Property owned or funded by Federal or other Sponsors\nAuthorization from the Sponsor may be required prior to disposal or sale. The DPA must work\nclosely with the Property Management Office in handling such transactions. Contact your\nProperty Service Representative (PSR) (http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-\noffices/property-management-pmo#property-service-representatives) for further instructions.\nb. Donated Equipment\nInternal Revenue Service requirements may restrict or prohibit sale of donated equipment. See\nGuide Memo 4.2.3 (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/giving-stanford/receiving-and-\nprocessing-gifts/records-donated-equipment): Records of Donated Equipment, for more\ninformation.\nc. Hazardous Equipment\n1. Contamination Risk\nPrior to release from the department, property must be decontaminated per Environmental\nHealth & Safety guidelines.  A list of items that must be sanitized is available at the\nEnvironmental Health & Safety (http://www.stanford.edu/dept/EHS/prod/) website. Items that\nrequire sanitization must have a letter confirming sanitization attached to the unit prior to being\npicked up or delivered to SPS.\n2. Injury Potential\nFor property with the potential to cause injury, SPS and the department will discuss whether the\nproperty should remain with the department pending final disposition, so that only people familiar\nwith the equipment will handle it.\nd. Software and Sensitive Data\nBefore delivery to SPS, departments must take steps to permanently remove University\nproprietary information from any computer or computer peripheral device. See Secure\nComputing \n(http://www.stanford.edu/group/security/securecomputing/data_destruction_guidelines.html)for a\ncomplete description of University policy regarding data sanitization. Special care should be\ntaken with licensed application software to ensure that the terms of the licensing agreement\nregarding sale or transfer have been observed.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/capital-\nassets-and-equipment/surplus-property-sales",

    "text": "5.2.5 Real Estate Leases\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Land, Buildings & Real Estate.\nLast Updated\nSeptember 1, 2016\nThis Guide Memo describes policies that apply to off-campus real estate leases. Capital and\noperating lease liabilities utilize the University’s debt capacity. All uses of debt must comply with\nthe University’s debt policy and require prior approval. The only parties authorized to execute\ndocuments that commit Stanford to real estate lease obligations are the Vice President for Land,\nBuildings & Real Estate; the Associate Vice President, Real Estate; or their designees.  For\nrelevant policies, see section 1 in Administrative Guide Memo 5.1.1: Procurement Policies\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/purchasing-\npolicies/procurement-policies). Approvals, requisition processes and reporting requirements are\nincluded.\n1. Definitions and Terms\nReal Estates Leases\nReal Estate Leases are contracts under which a lessee has committed to pay stipulated cash\npayments for the use of real estate for a specific period of time. Real Estate leases are\nconsidered long-term financial obligations of the University. Therefore, all new real estate leases\nand lease renewals are considered a use of the University’s debt capacity.\n2. Real Estate Leases\na. Background\nWhen the academic core campus becomes more space-constrained, academic and\nadministrative units begin to look for options outside of campus boundaries to fulfill their space\nrequirements. While physical planning on campus is centrally managed with rules and guidelines\nestablished by the University, locations off campus are subject to a completely different set of\njurisdictional regulations and University policies depending upon where a particular property is\nsituated. Prospective off-campus users should be made aware of these respective policies prior\nto choosing their final space destination. These policies are intended to address the political and\neconomic realities of locating an operation or unit outside the academic core campus.\nb. Off-Campus Leasing Requirements\n1. All off-campus users (whether occupying space on Stanford Real Estate Lands or not) are\nrequired to:\na. Confirm their use and/or proposed construction plan confirms with the local zoning\ncode\nb. Understand jurisdictional design and construction review and approval processes\nc. Pay all necessary fees for jurisdictional and University approval (GUP/SIP fees do not\napply)\nd. Engage their own resources, including leasing agent, to find space and negotiate the\nlease\ne. Self-administer leases\nf. Consult with LBRE before removing property from County property tax rolls\n \n2. If off-campus location is on Stanford Real Estate (SRE) lands, lessee will additionally be\nrequired to:\na. Understand that lessee’s direct landlord may be SRE’s ground lessee and that, in\nthose cases, SRE as well as the off-campus user are obligated to comply with the\nterms of the existing ground lease document\nb. In all cases (whether or not there is a ground lease between off-campus user and\nSRE), the off-campus user must obtain SRE approval for all major improvements and\nexterior changes to land and buildings, as well as any exceptions to jurisdictional\nzoning regulations\nc. If SRE is direct-owner of the building, obtain SRE approval of all interior\nimprovements; otherwise obtain approval from direct landlord (i.e. SRE’s ground\nlessee)\nd. Adhere to SRE design guidelines and/or policies for a particular location or district, if\napplicable (Stanford Research Park Handbook, Stanford Research Park Policy\nRegarding Medical Clinics, Welch Road Planning Guidelines, etc.)\ne. Understand that market rents will apply and be charged, even for SRE-owned\nbuildings\nc. Approval Process and Thresholds\nAll real estate leases must be included as a capital request in the Capital Planning Process. The\nCapital Planning Process is managed by the Vice President for Land, Buildings & Real Estate\nand occurs in conjunction with the annual budgeting process for the University. Departments are\nrequired to submit their capital plans  for approval as part of this process. Real estate lease\nsearches and/or negotiations initiated outside the Capital Planning Process must be approved by\nthe Vice President for Land, Buildings & Real Estate.\nAll real estate leases require separate approval from (1) the Vice President for Land, Buildings &\nReal Estate if the total anticipated contracted cash payments over the term of the lease are\nunder $1,000,000, or (2), the Provost if the total anticipated contracted cash payments are\n$1,000,000 or above. Real estate leases with total contracted cash payments of $5,000,000 and\nabove require approval by the Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees.\nd. Requisition\nPrior to negotiating lease terms, departments must submit an off-campus lease requisition form\nto the Associate Vice President, Real Estate. The form can be downloaded from the Land,\nBuildings & Real Estate website (http://lbre.stanford.edu/). The Associate Vice President, Real\nEstate will advise in the search, or direct the requestor to an approved real estate advisor.\ne. Approval Forms\nPrior to executing a lease, departments must submit an off-campus lease approval form to the\nAssociate Vice President, Real Estate. Real estate lease approval forms can be downloaded\nfrom the Land, Buildings & Real Estate website (http://lbre.stanford.edu/). After approval of the\nlease transaction and execution of the lease, departments must request a Purchase Order or BU\nnumber from Procurement for the total contracted cash payments over the term of the lease, to\nensure proper recording of the transaction and to enable payments.\nf. Lease Terms\nThe Associate Vice President, Real Estate or their designee, will assist departments in\nnegotiating lease terms. Real estate leases must be executed by the Vice President for Land,\nBuildings & Real Estate, the Associate Vice President, Real Estate or their designee, or the\nAdministrator designated by the Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees.  Material\nexceptions to standard terms must be reviewed and approved by the Office of the General\nCounsel.\ng. Reporting Requirements\nBy January 15 of each year, departments must provide Land, Buildings & Real Estate a schedule\nof all real estate lease obligations to assist with the preparation of the University’s College\nExemption property tax filing.\nh. Insurance\nLessor’s insurance for real estate leases should cover damage to the building and premises and\ninjury occurring in the building’s common areas. For more information, contact the Director of\nRisk Management.\ni. Change of Terms\nDepartments must observe the start and stop dates of the lease. Occupying the real estate\nproperty outside the terms of the agreement has significant contractual implications and may\nsubject Stanford to additional rental charges, early termination charges, and other liabilities. The\nlessor’s insurance may be valid only during the stated period. To terminate a real estate lease\nearly, the department must contact the Associate Vice President, Real Estate.\nj. Renewals and Extensions\nDepartments must follow the approval process to extend the duration of the original contract,\nexercise options included in the original contract, or renew a real estate lease.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/capital-\nassets-and-equipment/real-estate-leases",

Purchases can be initiated in iProcurement via one of\nthree methods:\n1. Catalog requisitions: Purchases made through Amazon Business and SmartMart Catalog\nSuppliers.\n2. Non-catalog requisitions: For goods or services not available through the university’s\ncatalog options.\n3. Procurement Contracts: Generally required for engaging an external party to perform a\nservice, including zero dollar ($0) agreements. Refer to the contract process\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/contracts).\nThe Office of Research Administration manages subawards\n(https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/subawards/proposing-\nsubaward), but payments are processed using iProcurement Purchase Orders. \n2. Roles and Responsibilities\nSpecific roles and responsibilities related to purchase requisitions include:\n1. Preparer: The department purchaser initiates purchase requisitions, including supplier\nselection (https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/selecting-supplier-or-\nindependent-contractor) and completing and attaching any required documentation, where\napplicable.\n2. Approver: The department approver reviews transactions for compliance and\nappropriateness. The approver may not report to the preparer or be the beneficiary of the\npurchase.\n3. School/unit management: Managers and financial approvers monitor purchasing activities\nand compliance with policies.\n4. Central review and approval, FMS Procurement Services:\na. Validates competitive supplier selection (https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-\ncontracts/resource/validation-competitive-supplier-selection) above a specified threshold for non-\ncatalog purchase requisitions.\nb. Holds designated authority (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-\nprinciples/signature-and-financial-approval-authority/signature-and) to draft, sign and execute\nprocurement contracts, as these create financial or non-financial obligations for the university.\nc. May route purchasing transactions to additional university offices and/or require additional\ndocumentation, for example a Data Risk Assessment (https://uit.stanford.edu/security/dra).\nFor an overview of roles and responsibilities in procurement activities, refer to Guide Memo\n5.1.1: Procurement Policies (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-\npayments/purchasing-policies/procurement-policies). \n3. Delivery and Receiving\na. Delivery Points\nDeliveries (https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/delivering-goods-and-services-\nstanford) usually go directly to the ordering department. Special procedures for hazardous\nmaterials are managed by the Environmental Health and Safety Office\n(https://ehs.stanford.edu/).  A Procurement buyer can advise on special delivery requirements. \nb. Receiving\nReceiving is required for capital equipment (https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-\ncontracts/purchase-and-manage-capital-equipment) and must be recorded for payment, refer to\nHow To: Receive Goods (https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/how-to/receive-goods)\nfor detailed procedures.\nc. Expediting\nProcurement can expedite orders when notified by a department or supplier\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/financial-support-center-fsc) that an order needs special attention,\nsuch as failed delivery.\nd. Claims\nUniversity departments handle shipping claims, but Procurement can assist with damage claims,\nreturns, or repairs of defective items. For losses or damage over $1,000, contact the Office of the\nChief Risk Officer (http://ocro.stanford.edu).\ne. U.S. Customs\nInternational shipments sent to Stanford require customs broker coordination.

Purpose of Blanket Purchase Orders\nIf a department frequently needs supplies or services from the same supplier, Procurement may\nestablish a blanket purchase order. Blanket purchase orders are established for varying periods,\nand allow the department to order directly from the supplier. The blanket purchase order contains\nordering and billing instructions, a price agreement, and a description of the goods or services\nthat can be ordered.\n2. Departmental Blanket Purchase Orders\na. Audit Trail\nThe ordering department is responsible for maintaining a complete audit trail of transactions\nunder a blanket purchase order. This includes administering and documenting the authority for\nissuing orders and maintaining records of transactions.\nb. Releases\nIndividual releases under Blanket Purchase Orders are not entered online in Oracle Financials.\nThe ordering department is responsible for tracking releases independently of online systems. All\nreleases must carry the Blanket Purchase Order Number, and any invoices presented must also\ncarry the Blanket Purchase Order Number.\n3. University-Wide Purchase Agreements\nThe Procurement Department may determine that the interests of productive business dictate a\nconsolidation of business activity. If many departments use one supplier, then Procurement may\nestablish a University-wide Purchase Agreement with that vendor.\na. Releases\nUniversity departments should enter a requisition, for each transaction released against a\nUniversity-Wide Purchase Agreement.\nb. Temporary Service\nAgency Agreements are established on a University-wide basis every two years. For information\nabout approved agencies, call Procurement. To obtain temporary service help from an agency on\nthe approved list, the department enters an appropriate requisition online. The Agency in turn\nreferences the approved Purchase Order Number on its invoice. The invoice and a copy of the\ntemporary employee's time sheet (previously approved and signed by the department\nrepresentative at the end of the employee's work) are sent to Accounts Payable for payment.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/purchasing-\ngoods-and-services/blanket-purchase-orders",

The\nuniversity offers a number of purchasing methods (https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-\ncontracts/purchasing-and-payment-methods), such as iProcurement, which should be\nconsidered for overall impact on time-savings and the university’s ability to reduce costs and\nmanage risk, compliance, and regulations. Using a PCard to purchase items should be limited to\ninstances where there is substantial benefit, such as to support a more immediate business need\nor for purchasing categories, like business meals, that cannot be facilitated in iProcurement.\nThere are two types of PCards with specific uses:\nIndividual PCard: Issued to and used only by a specific purchaser.\nDepartment PCard: Issued to a department and assigned to a custodian who can\nauthorize others within the department to use it.\n2. Roles and Responsibilities\nFor overarching roles and responsibilities in procurement activities, refer to Guide Memo 5.1.1:\nProcurement Policies (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-\npayments/purchasing-policies/procurement-policies).

If a PCard transaction\nremains unverified, the transaction will be force cleared\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/policy/clearing-aging-transactions) to the\nspecified guarantee account (PTA). Repeated failure to verify and approve PCard\ntransactions may result in card suspension.\nApprover: PCard transaction approvers are granted appropriate approval authority\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/authority/financial-transaction-approval) for the PTA to which\nthe PCard transaction is being charged.

Consequences of substantiated\nfinancial irregularities are addressed in Guide Memo 1.1.1: Code of Conduct\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/university-code-\nconduct/university-code-conduct).\n3. Permissible and Non-Permissible Purchases\nSee Fingate (https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/policy/stanford-purchasing-card-\npcard#anchor-42651-content) for an expanded list of categories of permissible and non\npermissible purchases: \nPermissible Purchases: Common items, such as office supplies, postage and mailing\nsupplies, periodic dues and memberships to professional organizations, and business\nmeals where no travel is involved.\nNon-Permissible Purchases: Items with specific compliance requirements such as\nhazardous chemicals, and moving, storage, and leasing expenses must utilize other\npurchasing methods. \n4.

It should be used in\nconjunction with resources and procedural information on the Gateway to Financial Activities\n(http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/index.html) website, including Guidelines for\nAdvances\n(http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/finsystem/expreq/res/guide_cat_advance.html) and\nthe How-To listing (http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/reimburse/quick_steps.html) in\nthe Reimbursement section.\n1. Funds Advanced for Business Expenses\na. Purpose of Expense Advances\nThe use of cash advances is expected to be rare, but may be appropriate to further University\nbusiness under certain circumstances including:\nPaying for travel (e.g., airfare or pre-paid lodging) for students, staff, and faculty who travel\ninfrequently on University business,\nFunding incentives for Human Subjects, or\nFinancial hardship\nAs a preferred alternative to an expense advance, the University has a travel card program\ndescribed on the Gateway to Financial Activities\n(http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/travel/travel_card_stanford.html)website. Any\nother advance request not explicitly listed above is considered an exception and requires prior\napproval by the Business Expense Manager within  Procurement Services. The University does\nnot allow expense advances for personal reasons.  \nb. Authorizing and Issuing Funds\nExpense advances are authorized by departments, and are issued to the individual who will be\nincurring expenses. Responsibility for the University funds remains with the individual until\nexpenditures are accounted for through an expense report in the Expense Requests system.\nc. Amount of Expense Advances\nThe amount advanced may not exceed the estimated cash required for the activity. All advances\nfor travel must include supporting documentation detailing the estimated travel expenses.\nHuman Subject incentives greater than $200 per subject cannot be advanced and must be\nprocessed as a direct non-purchase order payment in the Expense Requests system.\n2. Requesting an Expense Advance\na. Initiating a Request\nThe department initiates a request for an advance online using the Expense Requests system.\nSee How To: Create Advance Request\n(http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/finsystem/expreq/howto/create_advance.html).\nb. Timing of Request\nApproved expense advances must be received by the Business Expense department at least 10\nworking days before the date the funds are needed. Fees will be charged for expedited (“Rush”)\ndelivery of funds or if pickup at the \"Will Call\" window is requested.\nc. Delivery of Funds\nChecks for expense advances may be delivered by interdepartmental mail to the department,\nsent via U.S. Mail, deposited directly to the payee's bank account, or picked up at designated\n“Will Call” locations.\n3. Expense Reporting\na. Expense Reporting\nAn expense report must be submitted in the Expense Requests system no later than 60 days\nafter the completion of the activity (e.g., trip) in order to clear advances. Absent exceptional\ncircumstances, expenses submitted more than 60 days after the date of completion will be\nreported as taxable income to the individual. See How To: Clear an Advance\n(http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/finsystem/expreq/howto/clear_advance.html).\nb. Returning Unused Funds\nUnused funds, and funds that are no longer needed, must be promptly returned to the\nUniversity. \nIf an advance is outstanding more than 60 days past the expected clearing date, the advance will\nbe reported as taxable income to the individual to whom the advance was intended. In this\ncircumstance, the advance will be expensed to the account specified in the advance request.\nThe department is responsible for determining if the advance has been charged to the\nappropriate account.\nThe advance recipient will not be eligible to receive any future advances if the advance was not\nproperly cleared.\nSee How To: Return Unused Advance Funds\n(http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/finsystem/expreq/howto/return_unused_advance.html).\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/travel-and-\nbusiness-expenses/expense-advances",

    "text": "5.4.2 Business and Travel Expenses\nAuthority\nApproved by the Senior Associate Vice President for Finance.\nLast Updated\nNovember 6, 2024\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 36.7\nFollowing is the policy for business and travel expenses, including purchases of items to be\nowned by the university. This policy applies to expenditures from all university funding sources. It\nshould be used in conjunction with resources and procedural information on the Fingate website\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/). This policy is based on and in alignment with the expectations set\nforth by AGM 1.1.1: Code of Conduct (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-\nand-principles/university-code-conduct/university-code-conduct), AGM 5.1.1: Procurement\nPolicies (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/purchasing-\npolicies) and applicable federal regulations.\nApplicability:\nThis policy is applicable to direct payments and reimbursements of:\nBusiness expenses, such as meals and entertainment expenses\nExpenses incurred while traveling on university business\nPurchases to be owned by the university\n1. Purpose\nThe guiding policy (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-\nadministration/expenditure-management/responsibility-university-funds) for all university\nexpenditures requires that expenditures be:\n1. Reasonable and necessary\n2. Consistent with established university policies and practices applicable to the work of the\nuniversity, including instruction, research, and public service\n3. Consistent with sponsor or donor expenditure restrictions\nThe three principles above, along with any applicable federal regulations, are the drivers of all\nuniversity procurement policies. To contextualize these principles for business and travel\nexpenses:\nReasonable means that the nature and amount of the expense does not exceed that which\na prudent person would incur under the same circumstances. While these amounts may\nvary, a good test is whether the individual could defend the expense if it came under public\nscrutiny. \nA necessary expense is one that supports and furthers the university mission and its\nongoing operation.\nThe university has established maximum limits for business and travel expenses, including\nmeals, air and ground transportation, and hotel lodging. The limits and associated processes for\nthese reimbursements are available on the Fingate website\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/business-and-travel-expense-policies).\nSponsored Funding Source-Specific Restrictions \nFunding sources, including individual or corporate donors, government agencies, and non-\ngovernment sponsors may have varying restrictions for their use. \nRefer to the fund (award) documents for specific restrictions. However, two broadly-applicable\nrestrictions for sponsored awards are:\nUse of the per diem method (rates set by the U.S. government) is required for travel meal\nexpenses (https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/policy/travel-\nmeals#anchor-11326-content). \nCertain expenditures, such as entertainment, alcohol, and the costs for airfare classes\nabove economy must be charged to an unrestricted award.  \n2.  Reimbursement Policy: IRS Accountable Plan and\nRegulations Compliance\nThe university reimburses individuals in accordance with the IRS Accountable Plan\n(https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-463). Under this plan, business expense\nreimbursements can be excluded from the beneficiary taxable income if the expense has a\nbusiness connection, is substantiated and is submitted in a timely manner, as defined below. \na. Business Connection and Substantiation of Expense \nA business connection exists when expenses have been paid or incurred while performing\nuniversity business. The business connection should be justified through the business purpose\nand supporting documentation.\n1. The business purpose should clearly explain how the business expense is connected to the\nuniversity and supports its mission.\n2. Documentation, such as receipts, agendas and/or travel itinerary must support the\nbusiness purpose, and demonstrate that the amounts incurred are reasonable and within\nestablished limits. The IRS Accountable Plan, and therefore the university, only requires\nreceipts for expenses of $75 or more.\nb. Timeliness of Transaction\nA transaction must be prepared and submitted through the Expense Requests system\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/system/expense-requests) with all appropriate receipts and/or other\nbackup documentation within 60 days after the end of travel (for travel expenses), the expense\nposted date (for non travel expenses), or expected clearing date (for advances). Expenses\nsubmitted after 60 days may still be reimbursed but, in accordance with the IRS Accountable\nPlan, as taxable income to the beneficiary. See Topic Overview: Managing Aging and\nOutstanding Expense Transactions (https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/managing-\naging-and-outstanding-expense-transactions).\nc. Non-employee Travel: Students and Visitors\nIf the individual incurring the expense is not an employee of the university, additional\nrequirements apply.\nUndergraduate, graduate student and postdoc travel expenses may be certified as business\ntravel if they meet at least one of the following criteria:\nDirectly support a faculty member's project or research program (substantiated by attaching\na copy of the program) \nAre related to presenting at a conference (substantiated by attaching a copy of the\nconference program indicating the traveler as a speaker/presenter)\nAre an integral part of the undergraduate or graduate student's degree work\nAre directly related to the student's employment at the university.\nSee Student Travel expenses (https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/student-\ntravel) on Fingate.\nExpenses incurred by foreign visitors may be reimbursed if the visitor enters the United States on\nan appropriate visa. See 2.4.1: Visas for and Employment of Foreign Nationals\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/employment-general-\ninformation/visas-and-employment-foreign-nationals).\n3. Definitions\na. Business Expenses\nThe university pays directly or reimburses individuals for expenses that are necessary and\nappropriate to conduct university business. Depending on the category of the goods or services\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/categories-purchases), the most appropriate\npurchasing and payment method may vary (https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-\ncontracts/purchasing-and-payment-methods). Common types of business expenses include\nbusiness (https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/business-meals) and travel\nmeals (https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/travel-meals), lodging\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/lodging), airfare\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/airfare), and transportation\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/ground-transportation). Conference\nregistration and training fees (i.e., STAP) are other types of business expenses\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/other-reimbursable-business-expenses).\nFor some categories of business expenses, such as business meals\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/business-meals), the university has\nestablished maximums, which are regularly reviewed and updated in alignment with pricing\nindices. Schools and units are responsible for approving any transaction that exceeds these\nmaximums. In general, business expenses for persons not directly connected to the business\npurpose are not reimbursable (e.g., spouses, other family members). \nb. University-Sponsored Travel\nUniversity-sponsored travel is when the university pays directly or reimburses individuals for\ntravel expenses that are reasonable and necessary to conduct university business.

Student and\npostdoctoral scholar travel that is directly related to their individual course of study, or for which\nacademic credit may be awarded, is considered university-sponsored travel.\nSplit or Partially Funded Travel\nWhen reimbursable travel expenses are funded by the university and one or more external\norganizations the trip is considered university-sponsored travel and any portion of travel paid by\nthe university must follow this policy. Stanford University resources (i.e., booking channels or\npayment methods) may be used to book, purchase, or reimburse expenses for the Stanford\nportion of the travel.\nExternally-sponsored Travel\nWhen an outside institution or entity funds travel on that organization’s behalf and provides full\npayment for those travel expenses, the trip is considered externally sponsored. Stanford\nUniversity resources may not be used to book, purchase, or reimburse expenses for externally-\nsponsored travel. \nPersonal Travel\nWhen a personal component (https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/planning-\nand-booking-travel) of travel is added to a business trip, the university will only cover the costs of\nthe business component. The charge that would have been incurred without the personal\ncomponent must be documented and included in the reimbursement request.\n4. Paying for Travel\nGenerally, the Stanford Travel Card (TCard)\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/travel-and-business-\nexpenses/travel-cards) is the preferred payment method for travel costs that will not be\nreimbursed through the per diem method. Alternatively, personal funds may be used and a\nrequest for reimbursement can be submitted after travel is completed. For more information\nabout paying for travel, see Purchasing and Payment Methods on Fingate\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/purchasing-and-payment-methods).\nThe TCard (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-5/subchapter-4/policy-5-4-3) may be used\nto pay for trips that include a component of personal travel, but it may not be used to purchase\ntrips that are exclusively personal. In cases where the TCard is used to purchase trips with a\npersonal component, the individual is responsible for reimbursing the university for the additional\ncost. See How To Return Personal Expenses Charged to a Travel Card\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/how-to/return-personal-expenses-\ncharged-travel-card).\n5. Prohibited and Restricted Travel\nStanford University may strongly recommend against or restrict travel to or within countries\nwhere the U.S. Department of State has issued certain official Travel Advisory levels, where\nthere is other reliable information of significant health or safety risks, and/or where exigent\ncircumstances apply. See Office of International Affairs (https://international.stanford.edu/) for\nmore information. \n6.

    "text": "5.4.3 Travel Cards\nLast Updated\nNovember 5, 2025\nThis policy applies to all Stanford University employees and departments applying for or holding\na Stanford-issued Travel Card. For detailed procedures and resources, refer to the Stanford\nTravel Card (TCard) Program overview on Fingate (https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-\nexpenses/stanford-travel-card-tcard-program). This policy aligns with Administrative Guide Memo\n1.1.1: Code of Conduct (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-1/subchapter-1/policy-1-1-1),\nGuide Memo 5.1.1: Procurement Policies (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-\nand-payments/purchasing-policies), and applicable federal regulations.\nAuthority: Approved by the Senior Associate Vice President for Finance.\nApplicability: \nThis policy is applicable to direct purchases of travel and travel-related services incurred during\nuniversity-sponsored travel, such as airfare, lodging, ground transportation, and travel meals.\n1. Purpose\nTravel Cards (TCards) are university-liability credit cards issued to active and authorized\nemployees to pay for eligible travel and travel-related expenses in support of Stanford business.\nTCards are the recommended payment method (https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-\ncontracts/purchasing-and-payment-methods) for any travel costs not reimbursed through the per\ndiem method (https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/business-and-travel-\nexpenses#anchor-10651-content). They may not be used for personal expenses while traveling,\nexcept for incidental expenses that cannot be easily separated from a business charge.\nThere are two types of TCards:\nIndividual TCard: Issued to and used only by a specific active employee who travels\nfrequently on Stanford business.\nDepartment TCard: Issued to an active employee who is assigned as the cardholder for\nthe department. The cardholder uses the card to pay for university-sponsored travel for\noccasional travelers, students or non-employees. The Department TCard must remain in\nthe cardholder’s possession and  should not be given to travelers.\n2. Roles and Responsibilities\nFor overarching roles and responsibilities in procurement activities, refer to Guide Memo 5.1.1:\nProcurement Policies (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-\npayments/purchasing-policies/procurement-policies). Specific roles and responsibilities related to\nTravel Cards (https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/stanford-travel-card-tcard-\nprogram#anchor-42621-content) include:\nPurchaser\nThe individual or department TCard cardholder is responsible for all purchases made\non the card, complies with related policies, and provides applicable receipts and\ndocumentation.\nThe cardholder is personally responsible for ensuring prompt payment to Stanford\nUniversity for any non-reimbursable TCard charges.\nTo be issued a TCard, the individual must (https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-\ncontracts/stanfords-purchasing-card-pcard-program#anchor-42726-content)complete\nthe application process (https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-\nexpenses/stanford-travel-card-tcard-program#anchor-23301-content), which includes\ndesignating a guarantee account (PTA), a transaction verifier,; completing training,\nand obtaining appropriate approvals.\nPreparer and verifier\nThis individual prepares and submits expense reports to properly record travel-related\nexpenses and to request payment on behalf of Stanford-authorized travelers.\nDocumentation must be attached, along with a business purpose and account (PTA)\ninformation.\nThis individual is responsible for properly documenting and recording transactions in\na timely manner, including disputing or reporting any potentially fraudulent\ntransactions.\nTransactions verified later than 60 days after expenses are incurred (the later of the\ncredit card posted date or date travel is complete) are treated as taxable income to\nthe cardholder in accordance with the IRS Accountable Plan\n(https://www.irs.gov/publications/p463). If a TCard transaction remains unverified, it\nwill be force cleared (https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/policy/clearing-\naging-transactions) to the specified guarantee account (PTA). Repeated failure to\nverify and approve TCard transactions may result in card suspension.\nCardholders can prepare and verify their own transactions, but must route them to an\nauthorized approver who does not report to them and is not the transaction’s\nbeneficiary.\nApprover: TCard transaction approvers are granted appropriate approval authority\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/authority/financial-transaction-approval) for the PTA to which\nthe transaction is charged. The approver may not report to the individual who made the\npurchase or be the beneficiary on whose behalf the purchase was made.\nSchool/unit management\nManagers and financial approvers must monitor all TCard usage within their\norganization, ensuring timely processing and compliance with policies.\nCentral administration and oversight\nFinancial Management Services (FMS) oversees transaction compliance and may\nsuspend cards for non-compliance.\nTCard transactions are also subject to additional review by the Office of the Chief\nRisk Officer (Internal Audit and/or Ethics and Compliance) and external auditors.\nMisuse\nTCard charges that are found to solely benefit the individual (with the exception of incidental\npersonal expenses that cannot be easily separated from a business charge, and are promptly\nrepaid to the university) and/or charges deemed excessive or fraudulent will be subject to further\nreview and assessment by the appropriate office as outlined in Guide Memo 3.5.1: Financial\nIrregularities (https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/financial-\nirregularities/financial-irregularities). Consequences of substantiated financial irregularities are\ndescribed in Guide Memo 1.1.1: Code of Conduct\n(https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/university-code-\nconduct/university-code-conduct).\n3. Permissible and Non-Permissible Purchases\nFor an expanded list of permissible and non permissible purchases, see\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/policy/stanford-purchasing-card-pcard#anchor-\n42651-content)Fingate (https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/policy/stanford-\ntravel-card-tcard).\nPermissible purchases:\nGenerally, individual TCards may only be used for the cardholder’s university-\nsponsored travel expenses, such as airfare, lodging, travel meals, and ground\ntransportation.\nDepartment TCards may be used for travel expenses for occasional travelers,\nincluding students, groups, or university guests.\nNon-permissible purchases:\nNon-travel expenses, such as local business meals or virtual conference registration\n(where no travel is involved), are not allowed on a TCard.\nWhen charged to sponsored projects, TCard transactions must comply with the sponsoring\nagency’s policies, including allowability, and adhere to the requirements of the Fly America Act\nand Open Skies Exceptions (https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-\nexpenses/resource/federal-air-carrier-requirement) when using a federal award.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/business-and-\ntravel-expenses/travel-cards",

    "text": "5.4.4 Petty Cash Funds\nAuthority\nApproved by the Senior Associate Vice President for Finance.\nLast Updated\nNovember 2, 2015\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 36.6\nThis Guide Memo outlines policy on establishing and managing a petty cash fund. It should be\nused in conjunction with procedural information, resources, and forms, which outline the\napplication of this policy and may be found on the Petty Cash\n(https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/petty-cash) page on Fingate.\n1. Overview and Purpose\nThe purpose of a Petty Cash Fund is to allow for the reimbursement or purchase of minor, small-\ndollar (less than $100), unanticipated business expenses, where the use of alternative means is\nneither feasible nor cost effective. In general, departments are strongly encouraged to use\nStanford Purchasing Cards or to request reimbursement through the Expense Requests system\nrather than use petty cash, whenever possible. \n2. Principles\na. Authority\nThe Office of the Treasurer is responsible for approving all Petty Cash Fund account requests.\nb. Fund Types and Limits\nThe University has three types of Petty Cash Funds. Fund levels should be reassessed annually\nand modified as needed based on the volume of activity during the year.\n(1) Petty Cash Fund\nPetty Cash Funds are established for departmental use for incidental and emergency small-\ndollar purchases where the use of alternative means (e.g., Purchasing  Card) is not feasible.\nReimbursement for properly approved expenses may be obtained directly from this fund. The\nsize of a Petty Cash Fund will be determined by the business needs of the requesting\ndepartment, but will typically not exceed $500 in cash on hand, unless otherwise approved by\nthe Office of the Treasurer.\n(2) Petty Cash Checking Account\nPetty Cash Checking Accounts may be established in departments that make small\ndisbursements by mail (e.g. purchase of subscriptions), or that must make immediate payment\n(e.g. C.O.D. (cash on delivery) for goods delivered by UPS). The size of a Petty Cash Checking\nAccount will be based on the business needs of the requesting department, but will typically not\nexceed $2,500, unless otherwise approved by the Office of the Treasurer.\n(3) Change Fund\nChange Funds may be established by a department, used to give change to customers when\nthey are paying for goods and/or services, and must be reconciled daily. The size of a Change\nFund will be determined by the business needs of the requesting department. A written request\nwith the details of the business needs must be submitted to and approved by the Office of the\nTreasurer.\nc. Number of Petty Cash Funds per Department\nUnless the department is very large or geographically dispersed, a single petty cash fund per\ndepartment is usually adequate. Reimbursements from one petty cash fund may be charged to\nany type of account including sponsored projects. If more than one petty cash fund is needed, a\nwritten justification must be submitted to and approved by the Office of the Treasurer.\nd. Petty Cash Custodian\nThe department head must appoint an individual to be custodian of the department's petty cash\nfund. Petty cash custodians must be salaried employees of the University, and may not be\nundergraduate students, graduate students or temporary personnel. Custodians are required to\ncomplete Petty Cash Training.  The custodian remains accountable for the petty cash fund until\nanother person is officially designated as the new custodian, or the fund is closed.\ne. Periodic On-Site Audits of Petty Cash Funds\nThe Office of the Treasurer may conduct on-site audits of selected department Petty Cash\nFunds, Petty Cash Checking Accounts and Change Funds each year. The funds will be selected\nrandomly and the custodian for the selected fund(s) will be notified and an appointment to\nconduct the audit must be made within 72 hours. For an audit, the custodian will need to provide\nthe auditor with evidence of reconciliations, reimbursement receipts showing the types of\nreimbursements being made with the fund, and provide evidence that the fund is being stored\nsecurely when not in use.\nf. Handling of Petty Cash Funds\nFailure to properly safeguard, reconcile and administer petty cash funds may lead to revocation\nof the petty cash fund from the department and/or disciplinary action up to and including\ntermination.\n3. Uses of Petty Cash Funds\na. When Petty Cash May be Used\nReimbursements from petty cash are authorized for purchases and expenditures up to $100 per\ntransaction. Allowable uses:\n1. Incidental supplies needed for department operations totaling less than $100;\n2. Local transportation (e.g., taxi), parking (non-University related) and bridge tolls, totaling\nless than $100, that may arise as part of a day trip on official University business;\n3. Necessary and reasonable food (e.g., sandwiches and beverages) brought into the office\nfor business meetings, totaling $100 or less, including tax, delivery and tip.\nSpecial rules apply for the reimbursement of alcoholic beverages.\nb. When Petty Cash May Not be Used\nPetty cash may NOT be used for:\nPayment for services performed by employees or non-employees\nAdvances\nGifts\nPersonal loans and cashing personal checks\nBuying hazardous materials\nStanford Faculty Club dues\nUniversity parking fees\nTraffic citations\nPersonal expenses\nInterest charges\nSocial or travel club dues\nExpenses incurred more than 120 days prior to the petty cash reimbursement request\n(anything older than 120 days must be reimbursed through the Expense Requests system\nRecurring expenses (e.g. employee business-related home internet or cell phone\nexpenses)\nAmounts over $100, unless a department requests, and the Office of the Treasurer\napproves, a higher limit for the department\nTransactions involving students (e.g., students receiving any type of cash from stipends,\nexcess financial aid, or refund of excess tuition payments must be processed through\nFinancial Aid and Student Financial Services)\nc. Accounting\nReimbursement for petty cash must be for the exact amount of the expense. Splitting one\ntransaction in excess of $100 into several parts, or requesting reimbursement of less than the full\namount of the expense is specifically not allowed.\nReferences\nThis policy should be read in conjunction with the following related policies and procedures.\nAdditional information (i.e., procedures and forms) related to Petty Cash may be found on the\nPetty Cash (https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/petty-cash) page on Fingate.\nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/business-and-\ntravel-expenses/petty-cash-funds",

    "text": "5.5.1 External Affirmative Action\nAuthority\nApproved by the Provost.\nLast Updated\nDecember 15, 2008\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 58\nThis policy statement supports a plan to increase opportunities for minority, women and  people\nwith disabilities, and businesses owned by them, to participate in economic opportunities arising\nfrom University business activities.\n1. Stanford Policy\nStanford University is committed to increasing significantly the opportunities for minority, women\nand disabled people to engage in business with the University.\na. Purpose\nThis policy statement supports a long-range plan to enhance Stanford's external affirmative\naction. The plan serves to promote diversity through the judicious use of the University's financial\nand other resources to increase opportunities for small businesses and businesses owned by\ntargeted concerns to participate in economic opportunities arising from University business\nactivities.\nb. Scope\nThe classes covered by this policy, as defined by the Federal Government, include Asian, Black,\nLatino/Hispanic and Native American, women of all racial/ethnic background, people who are\ndisabled or physically challenged, veterans, and other targeted concerns.\nc. Implementation\nThe President and Provost will provide the leadership for promulgating this policy; however,\nresponsibility for its implementation rests with individual vice presidents, deans, directors of\nmajor institutions and centers, the Chief Executive Officer of the Stanford Management\nCompany, and the heads of other organizations not covered above.\n2. Federal Contracts\nPublic Law 95-507 and Executive Order 12138 encourage organizations that receive contracts\nfrom federal agencies to do business with small businesses and other targeted concerns\nregardless of size. The University's responsibilities under these laws are described in detail in the\ndocument \"Utilization of Small Business Concerns, Small Business Concerns Owned and\nControlled by Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals, and Women-Owned\nBusiness Concerns,\" which is published in the Procurement Manual. Specific questions as to\napplicability to particular situations should be addressed to the Office of Sponsored Research.\na. Definitions\n\"Socially disadvantaged individuals are those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic\nprejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to\ntheir individual qualities. The social disadvantage of individuals must stem from\ncircumstances beyond their control.\" 13 CFR 124.1-1(c)(3)(i)\n\"Economically disadvantaged individuals are socially disadvantaged individuals whose\nability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished\ncapital and credit opportunities, as compared to others in the same line of business and\ncompetitive market area who are not socially disadvantaged.\" 13 CFR 124.1-1(c)(4)(i)\nThe Small Business Administration (SBA) defines the members of these groups. An updated\nlisting can be found online at the U.S. Small Business Administration (https://www.sba.gov/about-\nsba/sba-performance/policy-regulations/laws-regulations/code-federal-regulations-cfr/part-124-\n8a-business-development-small-disadvantaged-business-status-determinations) website. \nSubcontract: \"Any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship)\nentered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies\nor services required for the performance of the original contract or subcontract.\" Office of\nFederal Procurement Policy Letter 80-2.Under this definition, subcontracting means every\npurchase order and agreement, as well as other expenses such as travel.\nb. Contracts Affected\n(1) Contracts between $25,000 and $499,999\nTerms of government contracts over $25,000 in value require the University to have a program to\ninsure business opportunities for small and minority owned businesses. Stanford's External\nAffirmative Action Program meets that requirement.\n(2) Contracts $500,000 and over\nFor contracts of $500,000 or more, a specific plan must be made and implemented. A Small\nBusiness Liaison Officer (a Stanford-designated University official) oversees the operation of the\nplan. The University is responsible for establishing percentage goals of subcontracting business\n(expressed as a proportion of total subcontracting dollars) to be awarded to small and small\ndisadvantaged suppliers. For assistance or information on goals required by specific agencies,\ncontact the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR).\nc. Procedures\n(1) Preparing the Subcontracting Plan\nWhen a request for a subcontracting plan is received from an agency, OSR notifies the cognizant\ndepartment and Procurement. Procurement and the department meet to review product and\nservice areas with subcontracting opportunities, and based on this review, determine reasonable\ngoals for the plan. Procurement submits data for the plan to OSR. Procurement then writes the\nsubcontracting plan and submits it to the government agency.\n(2) Vendor Search\nDepartments must investigate small and disadvantaged business possibilities prior to submitting\na requisition. Departments that wish further searching to be done by Procurement should so\nspecify in the \"Remarks\" screen of the requisition, and should attach documentation of the\ndepartment's search efforts and their results.\n(3) Reports\nThe federal government requires periodic reports on progress toward the achievement of goals\nset in a contract's original subcontracting plan. Procurement prepares reports of purchases under\neach contract, and notifies departments of progress against goals.\n3. Sources of Business Information\na. Directories\nTo help departments, Procurement maintains small business directories and other resources. All\nthe directories are commodity-indexed. Call Procurement for copies and information.\nb. Online Access to Supplier Information\nOnline information about vendor size, ownership status and products offered is available to\ndepartments in the Oracle Financials system. Procurement Buyers are also available to assist\nwith sourcing needs.\nc. SBA CCR System\nThe Small Business Administration has developed a computerized, commodity indexed database\nof small businesses. Call Procurement for more information. Procurement maintains links to this\nand other resources on the Gateway to Financial Activities\n(http://fingate.stanford.edu/staff/buypaying/index.html) website. \nSource URL: https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/external-\naffirmative-action/external-affirmative-action",
